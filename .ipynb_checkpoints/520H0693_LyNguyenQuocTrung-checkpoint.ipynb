\"How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?\" Or, \"How can I make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis?\" So, doing one well is difficult\\n', ' Doing both well as the same time is art -- pushing both exploration and exploitation\\n', \"So one thing we've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and

about how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars; and how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets\\n\", \" And yes, I'm talking about smartphones \\n\", ' not self-driving cars\\n', \"But to get started we've got to go back over 100 years\\n\", ' Because it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber\\n', 'So let me introduce you to the jitney\\n', ' In 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper\\n', ' He was a car salesman from LA, and he had an idea\\n', ' Well, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles, my hometown, and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go\\n', \" He said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney -- that was slang for a nickel\\n\", ' And within one year, by 1915, there were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle, 45,000 rides per day in Kansas and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles\\n', ' To give you some perspective, Uber in Los Angeles is doing 157,000 rides per day, today \\n', 'And so these are the trolley guys, the existing transportation monopoly at the time\\n', ' They were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut\\n', ' And so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney\\n', 'And there were all kinds of regulations\\n', ' There were licenses -- often they were pricey\\n', ' In some cities, if you were a jitney driver, you were required to be in the jitney for 16 hours a day\\n', ' In other cities, they required two jitney drivers for one jitney\\n', ' But there was a really interesting regulation which was they had to put a backseat light -- install it in every Jitney -- to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning\\n', 'All right\\n', ' But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated completely out of existence\\n', \"That's unfortunate \\n\", \" because, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one\\n\", \" And car ownership skyrocketed and it's no wonder that by 2007, there was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States\\n\", ' In China by 2011, there were more car sales happening in China than in the US\\n', 'Now, all this private ownership of course had a public cost\\n', ' In the US, we spend 7 billion hours a year, wasted, sitting in traffic\\n', \"Now, that's only four percent of our problem though\\n\", ' Because if you have to own a car then that means 96 percent of the time your car is sitting idle\\n', ' And so, up to 30 percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel\\n', ' We even have skyscrapers built for cars\\n', \" That's the world we live in today\\n\", 'Now, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades\\n', \" It's called mass transit\\n\", ' And even in a city like New York City, one of the most densely populated in the world and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world, there are still 2\\n', \" Why is that? Well, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out how to get to everybody's doorstep\\n\", \" And so back in San Francisco, where I live, the situation's much worse, in fact, much worse around the world\\n\", 'And so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was -- well, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride\\n', \" We didn't have any grand ambitions\\n\", ' But it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride, and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides\\n', ' We saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place\\n', 'And so we started thinking about, well, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one\\n', \" Because if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper -- up to 50 percent cheaper -- and of course for the city you've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars\\n\", 'And so the big question for us was: would it work? Could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it? And the answer, fortunately, is a resounding yes\\n', 'In San Francisco, before uberPOOL, we had -- well, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted\\n', ' And the bright colors is where we have the most cars\\n', \" And once we introduced uberPOOL, well, you see there's not as many bright colors\\n\", ' More people getting around the city in fewer cars, taking cars off the road\\n', ' It looks like uberPOOL is working\\n', \" And since then, we've taken 7\\n\", \"9 million miles off the roads and we've taken 1\\n\", '4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air\\n', 'But my favorite statistic -- remember, I\\'m from LA, I spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel, going, \"How do we fix this?\" -- my favorite part is that eight months later, we have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week\\n', \" And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen\\n\", \" In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too\\n\", ' And when I talk to my team, we don\\'t talk about, \"Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we\\'re done\\n', '\" How do we get that to a million? And in China, well, that could be several million\\n', 'And so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling\\n', ' But what about the suburbs?\\n', \"This is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles, it's actually a suburb called Northridge, California, and, well -- look, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever\\n\", ' And every morning at about the same time, cars roll of out their driveway, most of them, one person in the car, and they go to work, they go to their place of work\\n', 'Well, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE\\n', ' You get up in the morning, get ready for work, get your coffee, go to your car and you light up the Uber app, and all of a sudden, you become an Uber driver\\n', \" And we'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work and it's a really great thing\\n\", \"There's just one hitch \\n\", \" it's called regulation\\n\", \" You can pick up anybody in the United States and take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice, for 54 cents a mile or less\\n\", \" But if you charge 60 cents a mile, you're a criminal\\n\", \" But what if for 60 cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles? And what if at 60 cents a mile we could get 50 million people carpooling in the United States? If we could, it's obviously something we should do\\n\", 'And so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney\\n', ' If by 1915 this thing was taking off, imagine without the regulations that happened, if that thing could just keep going\\n', ' How would our cities be different today? Would we have parks in the place of parking lots? Well, we lost that chance\\n', ' But technology has given us another opportunity\\n', \"Now, I'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars but do we have to really wait five, 10 or even 20 years to make our new cities a reality? With the technology in our pockets today, and a little smart regulation, we can turn every car into a shared car, and we can reclaim our cities starting today\\n\", 'Thank you\\n', ' Travis, thank you\\n', ' Thank you\\n', \" You know -- I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding\\n\", \" You only just talked about a small part of it here -- a powerful part -- the idea of turning cars into public transport like that, it's cool\\n\", \" But I've got a couple other questions because I know they're out there on people's minds\\n\", ' You had this very radical, very bold, brave redesign\\n', ' Sure\\n', ' How did it go?

How has the situation come to this, that we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?\\n\", \" I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision, a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world\\n\", ' And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two really fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask\\n', ' First, why is the current system not working? And second, what can we do to fix it?\\n', 'So the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys\\n', ' Its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people, people have somewhere to go, to live in safety and dignity until they can go home\\n', ' It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today\\n', ' Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, UNHCR, states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory who flee conflict and persecution\\n', 'But today, that system is failing\\n', ' In theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum\\n', \" In theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration, or return to the country they've come from\\n\", ' But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo\\n', ' In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility\\n', \" In practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees\\n\", \" The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong\\n\", \" It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world, and that's what we need to reconsider\\n\", 'So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works\\n', ' How does the refugee regime actually work? But not from a top-down institutional perspective, rather from the perspective of a refugee\\n', ' So imagine a Syrian woman\\n', \" And Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region\\n\", \" And so Amira can't go back there\\n\", \" But Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country, because that's a lottery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees\\n\", 'So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice\\n', ' They have three basic options\\n', ' The first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp\\n', ' In the camp, she might get assistance, but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family\\n', ' Camps are in bleak, arid locations, often in the desert\\n', ' In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime\\n', ' Education is often of poor quality\\n', \" It's a miserable existence, and that's probably why, in reality, only nine percent of Syrians choose that option\\n\", 'Alternatively, Amira can head to an urban area in a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut\\n', \" That's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken\\n\", \" They don't usually get significant access to assistance\\n\", \" And so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings, they're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution\\n\", \" Amira can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today\\n\", 'Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys\\n', ' For refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today\\n', \" But I think it's a false choice\\n\", \" The reason why we limit those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refugees, and they're not\\n\", \" Politicians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue, that if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens\\n\", ' We tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society\\n', \" But they don't have to\\n\", ' They can contribute\\n', 'So what I want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set and still benefit everyone else: the host states and communities, our societies and refugees themselves\\n', ' And I want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees\\n', \" All four ways have one thing in common: they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization, mobility and markets, and update the way we think about the refugee issue\\n\", \"The first one I want to think about is the idea of enabling environments, and it starts from a very basic recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but they're just in extraordinary circumstances\\n\", \" Together with my colleagues in Oxford, we've embarked on a research project in Uganda looking at the economic lives of refugees\\n\", \" We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries\\n\", \" It's not\\n\", \" It's exceptional\\n\", ' Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity\\n', ' It gives them the right to work\\n', ' And the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community\\n', ' In the capital city, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people, and 40 percent of those employees are nationals of the host country\\n', ' In other words, refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country\\n', ' Even in the camps, we found extraordinary examples of vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses\\n', 'For example, in a settlement called Nakivale, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music exchange businesses\\n', \" We found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions\\n\", ' Demou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a filmmaker\\n', \" So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a video camera, and he's now making films\\n\", \" He made two documentary films with and for our team, and he's making a successful business out of very little\\n\", \" It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees\\n\", ' Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing\\n', 'Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are all important in the emergency phase, but we need to also look beyond that\\n', ' We need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking\\n', ' All the ways in which we take for granted that we are plugged in to the global economy can and should apply to refugees\\n', 'The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones\\n', ' Unfortunately, not every host country in the world takes the approach Uganda has taken\\n', \" Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees in the same way\\n\", \"Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier, and we brainstormed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to bring jobs to Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy\\n\", ' The idea is for an economic zone, one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals\\n', ' And just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, is an existing economic zone called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area\\n', ' The government has spent over a hundred million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network, but it lacked two things: access to labor and inward investment\\n', ' So what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camps, able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they go back to Syria? We recognized that that could benefit Jordan, whose development strategy requires it to make the leap as a middle income country to manufacturing\\n', ' It could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute to the postconflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to incubate refugees as the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria\\n', 'We published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs\\n', ' King Abdullah has picked up on the idea\\n', 'The third idea that I want to put to you is preference matching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee\\n', \" What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but I'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off\\n\", ' The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets, ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match\\n', ' My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees, to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations, but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match\\n', \" Now, of course you'd need to build in quotas on things like diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching\\n\", ' The matching idea has been successfully used to match, for instance, students with university places, to match kidney donors with patients, and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites\\n', ' So why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?\\n', ' And at the moment, in my country, for instance, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities, which makes no sense at all\\n', ' So matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host and the refugees themselves\\n', 'The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas\\n', \" Much of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe was entirely avoidable\\n\", \" It stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy, which is the following: that in order to seek asylum in Europe, you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys that I described\\n\", \" But why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline and modern consular capabilities?

I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years\\n\", ' But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks?\\n', 'So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys\\n', 'So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers\\n', 'Thank you very much\\n', 'Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time\\n', 'Of course there are other challenges -- health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism\\n', \" However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated\\n\", \"More importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long-term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development\\n\", 'The fundamental question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis?\\n', 'They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity\\n', ' In particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling\\n', ' Worse than that, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing\\n', ' With economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards\\n', ' Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived\\n', ' If growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller\\n', 'The context matters\\n', ' And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries\\n', 'Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition\\n', \" There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth\\n\", \" And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources -- arable land, potable water, energy and minerals\\n\", ' You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment\\n', ' And you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt\\n', \"But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world\\n\", \" And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism\\n\", \"It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism\\n\", ' And as I mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors\\n', ' And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy\\n', ' Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad\\n', ' When in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum\\n', ' And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist\\n', 'Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism\\n', 'However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States\\n', \" This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many\\n\", 'The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills\\n', \" And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts\\n\", ' But nevertheless, this framework -- this two-stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model\\n', 'I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge\\n', ' First of all, we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism\\n', 'In particular, right-leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth\\n', ' For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that\\n', 'Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York\\n', \" Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China\\n\", \" But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs\\n\", ' Of course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, NGOs and private sector\\n', 'Two very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public-private partnerships\\n', ' More recently, of course, the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society\\n', 'My fundamental message to you is this: We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological\\n', \" In order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work\\n\", ' What do you say to those who react that way?\\n', \" There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards\\n\", \" And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world\\n\", ' Do you see that happening?\\n', \" Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity\\n\", ' I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is\\n', \"However, we've seen the Club of Rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid\\n\", \" And so in that sense, I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do\\n\", \" The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism -- with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues\\n\", \" Is that what you're suggesting?\\n\", ' I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to\\n', \" And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the United States, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism -- to the extent that it is free -- free market capitalism as its economic stance\\n\", ' The second largest economy is China\\n', ' It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model\\n', ' These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient\\n', ' One last question\\n', ' The COP21 is going on in Paris\\n', ' If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there, what would you say?\\n', ' Again, I would be very much about being open-minded\\n', \" As you're aware, the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now -- in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm -- and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement, in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want\\n\", \" Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries\\n\", \" Developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their CO2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in R&D\\n\", ' And so they have to come to the table as well\\n', \" But in essence, it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets\\n\", 'Hello\\n',

sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone\\n', \" We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team is outstanding\\n\", ' We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola\\n', 'And unfortunately, that day came\\n', ' On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the

to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on\\n', \" It could've stopped something\\n\", ' But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already been breeding for months\\n', ' With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks\\n', ' And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case,

cases -- all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this\\n', 'And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could, trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention, but we also did one other simple thing\\n', \" From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can discard it, obviously\\n\", \" The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did\\n\", ' We sent it to Boston, where my team works\\n', ' This

work are simple and they're powerful\\n\", ' We could actually take these 99 different viruses, look at them and compare them, and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Guinea, we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before, once into the human population, and from there had been transmitting from human to human\\n', \" Now, that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is contact tracing\\n\", ' We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mutating\\n', ' And so global health experts would need to respond, would have to develop, to recalibrate everything that they were doing\\n', 'But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point is, I had the data, and I could have worked in a silo for many, many months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths,

And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience\\n', ' Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move, and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion\\n', \" But the more I work in biorobotics, the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion\\n\", ' If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around, or even us as humans, when you go jogging or play tennis, we do amazing things\\n', ' And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem\\n', ' It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly, because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion\\n', ' The first component is just the body, and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals\\n', ' Then you have the spinal cord, and in the spinal cord you find reflexes, multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity\\n', ' A third component are central pattern generators\\n', ' These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate, by themselves, very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity while receiving only very simple input signals\\n', ' And these input signals coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain, like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, will all modulate activity of the spinal cord while we do locomotion\\n', \" But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component, the spinal cord, together with the body, already solve a big part of the locomotion problem\\n\", ' You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken, it can still run for a while, showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body, already solve a big part of locomotion\\n', 'Now, understanding how this works is very complex, because first of all, recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult\\n', \" It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex than in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae\\n\", ' Especially in humans, very hard to do\\n', ' A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between these four components\\n', \" So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time\\n\", ' This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models can really help\\n', \"So what's biorobotics? Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors, like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots\\n\", ' And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain -- stairs, mountains, forests, places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job\\n', ' The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well\\n', ' There are some very nice projects where robots are used, like a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics\\n', ' So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France, and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots\\n', ' And here we want to start simple\\n', \"So it's good to start with simple animals like lampreys, which are very primitive fish, and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion, like in salamanders, but also in cats and in humans, in mammals\\n\", ' And in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true\\n', ' Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my PhD\\n', ' But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations\\n', \" Like, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground, it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer\\n\", ' Why not have a real robot and real physics? So among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander\\n', \" You might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian, it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view\\n\", \"So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait, so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail\\n\", \" And if you place the salamander on the ground, it switches to what's called a walking trot gait\\n\", \" In this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body, and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot\\n\", ' Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body\\n', \" So if you take a decerebrated salamander -- it's not so nice but you remove the head -- and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord, at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait\\n\", ' If you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates\\n', \" And at some point, there's a threshold, and automatically, the animal switches to swimming\\n\", ' This is amazing\\n', ' Just changing the global drive, as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord, makes a complete switch between two very different gaits\\n', ' And in fact, the same has been observed in cats\\n', ' If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat, you can switch between walk, trot and gallop\\n', ' And thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail\\n', \" That's what we did\\n\", ' So we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3D\\n', ' And what we did is collect a whole database of motions, both on ground and in water, to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do\\n', ' And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot\\n', ' So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure, where to place the motors, how to connect them together, to be able to replay these motions as well as possible\\n', ' And this is how Pleurobot came to life\\n', ' So what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot\\n', ' You can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay of the walking gait\\n', ' If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better\\n', ' But even better, we can do swimming\\n', ' So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot --\\n', 'and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits\\n', ' And here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do\\n', ' The physics of interaction are complex\\n', \" Our robot is much bigger than a small animal, so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics\\n\", \" So let's go to the spinal cord\\n\", ' So here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits\\n', \" And what's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit, which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey, this primitive eel-like fish, and it looks like during evolution, new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs, to do the leg locomotion\\n\", ' And we tested that on board of a robot\\n', ' And the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain\\n', \" And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals, we can completely control speed, heading and type of gait\\n\", ' And finally, we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other\\n', \" And I think it's really beautiful how nature has distributed control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle\\n\", \" It just has to worry about this high-level modulation, and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles\\n\", \"So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics\\n\", ' So this is another project where we studied cat biomechanics, and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion\\n', ' And we found three important criteria in the properties, basically, of the limbs\\n', ' The first one is that a cat limb more or less looks like a pantograph-like structure\\n', ' So a pantograph is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel\\n', ' So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments\\n', ' A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight\\n', ' Most of the muscles are in the trunk, which is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly\\n', ' The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb, so to handle impacts and forces\\n', ' And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub\\n', \"So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage\\n\", \" So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot\\n\", ' It looks a bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat\\n', \" So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break\\n\", ' It will just jump, in fact\\n', ' And this very elastic property is also very important\\n', ' And you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph\\n', \" And that's interesting, because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait, and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion\\n\", ' To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion, as you will see in the next video, where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step, and the robot will not fall over, which was a surprise for us\\n', ' This is a small perturbation\\n', ' I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over, because there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop\\n', \" But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait, and the robot doesn't fall over\\n\", ' Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles, you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything\\n', \" But what's important here is that just for small perturbation, the mechanics are right\\n\", \" And I think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience, saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion\\n\", 'Now, how does this relate to human locomotion? Clearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion, but at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates\\n', \" That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord, this has dramatic effects\\n\", ' The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic\\n', ' This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord\\n', ' Especially, it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion\\n', ' So a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication using electrical or chemical stimulations\\n', ' And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that, especially at EPFL\\n', ' My colleagues Gr√©goire Courtine and Silvestro Micera, with whom I collaborate\\n', \"But to do this properly, it's very important to understand how the spinal cord works, how it interacts with the body, and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord\\n\", \" This is where the robots and models that I've presented today will hopefully play a key role towards these very important goals\\n\", 'Thank you\\n', \" Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots that do things like swim in pollution and measure the pollution while they swim\\n\", ' But for this one, you mentioned in your talk, like a side project, search and rescue, and it does have a camera on its nose\\n', ' Absolutely\\n', ' And the big dream is to, if you have a difficult situation like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded, and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs, why not send in a robot that can crawl around, swim, walk, with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors and possibly create a communication link with the survivor\\n', \" Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this\\n\", ' Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit, because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you\\n', \" But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust, I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it\\n\", ' Thank you very much\\n', ' Thank you and your team\\n', 'It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005\\n', \" I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor\\n\", ' I really, really loved my job, but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged\\n', \"So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office\\n\", ' Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years, so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights\\n', 'I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck\\n', ' I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties -- super interesting\\n', ' But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way, in a way that could really make a difference\\n', 'So Chris cut right to the chase, and he says, \"Well, of all the issues you\\'ve been looking at, what are the top five?\"\\n', '\"Well, there\\'s genetic discrimination, and reproductive technologies, and biobanking, and \\n', \" oh, there's this really cool issue, functional MRI and using it for lie detection, and \\n\", \" oh, and of course, there's gene patents\\n\", '\"\\n', '\"Gene patents?\"\\n', '\"Yes, you know, patents on human genes\\n', '\"\\n', '\"\\n', 'I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles\\n', ' And 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office\\n', ' \"Oh my god! You\\'re right! Who can we sue?\"\\n', 'Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer, but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics\\n', 'First, we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene\\n', ' Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims, but the most controversial of these are to so-called \"isolated DNA\" -- namely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell\\n', 'Gene patent proponents say, \"See? We didn\\'t patent the gene in your body, we patented an isolated gene\\n', '\" And that\\'s true, but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated\\n', \" And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated, but on every possible version of that gene\\n\", 'So what does that mean?\\n', \"That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it, say, to see if it has any mutations, without permission of the patent holder\\n\", ' It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing\\n', ' Allowing patent holders, often private companies, to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients\\n', ' The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome\\n', ' But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it\\n', ' So another lab tried to offer the test, but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement\\n', ' So as a result, for 2 years, no test was available\\n', ' During that time, Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT\\n', ' But was there a way we could challenge them?\\n', 'Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases, that certain things are not patent eligible\\n', \" You can't patent products of nature -- the air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table\\n\", \"It seemed to us that DNA, the most fundamental structure of life, that codes for the production of all of our proteins, is both a product of nature and a law of nature, regardless of whether it's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube\\n\", ' Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy, and, at least in theory, as a matter of law\\n', ' There were literally thousands of patents on human genes\\n', ' The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo, the biotech industry had grown up around this practice, and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress, and had gone absolutely nowhere\\n', \" So the bottom line: courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents\\n\", ' So we set out to build our case\\n', 'Now, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B over some really narrow, obscure technical issue\\n', \" We weren't really interested in that kind of case, and we thought this case was much bigger than that\\n\", ' This was about scientific freedom, medical progress, the rights of patients\\n', ' So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case -- more like a civil rights case\\n', 'We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation\\n', ' Myriad held patents on two genes, the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes\\n', ' Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States\\n', ' It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop\\n', ' It charged a lot of money for its test -- over 3,000 dollars\\n', ' It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community\\n', ' And perhaps worst of all, for a period of several years, Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France\\n', 'It has been estimated that during that period, for several years, as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer -- a negative test result that should have been positive\\n', \" Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad\\n\", ' The test was negative\\n', \" That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family, and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested\\n\", ' But two years later, Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer\\n', ' Had Eileen received the proper result, Kathleen would have then been tested, and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented\\n', 'Once we settled on Myriad, we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems\\n', \" We ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs: genetic counselors, geneticists who had received cease and desist letters, advocacy organizations, four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals, and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test, or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not, as a result of the patents\\n\", 'We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts, trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately\\n', \"So isolating DNA -- it's like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed\\n\", \" You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold, but you can't patent the gold itself\\n\", \" It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain; you still can't patent it, it's still gold\\n\", \" And the gold, once it's extracted, can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain; you can make jewelry out of it for example -- still can't patent the gold, it's still

two judges who ruled against us, did so for completely different reasons\\n', ' The first one, Judge Lourie, made up his own novel, biological theory -- totally wrong\\n', 'He decided Myriad had

And how can fictive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture, while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time?\\n', ' So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships, both in a programmatic and functional way and in an experiential and emotive or social way\\n', ' When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002, the city planners showed us this image: a forest of several hundred skyscrapers to emerge in the central business district, except at that time, only a handful of them existed\\n', ' So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about, except one thing: it would all be about verticality\\n', \"Of course, the skyscraper is vertical -- it's a profoundly hierarchical structure, the top always the best, the bottom the worst, and the taller you are, the better, so it seems\\n\", ' Our idea was to bring all aspects of television-making into one single structure: news, program production, broadcasting, research and training, administration -- all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration\\n', 'I still very much like this image\\n', ' It reminds one of biology classes, if you remember the human body with all its organs and circulatory systems, like at school\\n', ' And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance, but as an organism, as a life form\\n', ' And as you start to dissect this organism, you can identify a series of primary technical clusters -- program production, broadcasting center and news\\n', ' Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters: meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas -- informal spaces for people to meet and exchange\\n', ' So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social, the human and the performative\\n', ' And of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system, to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity\\n', 'With 473,000 square meters, it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world\\n', ' It has a population of over 10,000 people, and of course, this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension of many things and the scale of typical architecture\\n', ' So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks and glued them onto a model, just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant\\n', ' So it was a way to script and design the building, but of course, also to communicate its experiences\\n', 'This is the main broadcast control room, a technical installation so large, it can broadcast over 200 channels simultaneously\\n', ' And this is how the building stands in Beijing today\\n', ' Its first broadcast live was the London Olympics 2012, after it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics\\n', ' And you can see at the very tip of this 75-meter cantilever, those three little circles\\n', \" And they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building\\n\", \" They're a piece of glass that you can stand on and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion\\n\", 'The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing\\n', ' It is there\\n', ' It has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography\\n', 'But its most important moment is maybe sill this one\\n', ' \"That\\'s Beijing\" is similar to \"Time Out,\" a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week, and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter, but actually as an urban actor, as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city\\n', ' So architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player, of something that writes stories and performs stories\\n', ' And I think that could be one of its primary meanings that we believe in\\n', ' It is the story of the people that made it -- 400 engineers and architects that I was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building, in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built in China\\n', 'This is a residential development in Singapore, large scale\\n', ' If we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world, of course, it is dominated by the tower, a typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness, and I wanted to ask, how could we think about living, not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves and our apartment, but in an idea of a collective? How could we think about creating a communal environment in which sharing things was as great as having your own?\\n', \"The typical answer to the question -- we had to design 1,040 apartments -- would have looked like this: 24-story height limit given by the planning authorities, 12 towers with nothing but residual in between -- a very tight system that, although the tower isolates you, it doesn't even give you privacy, because you're so close to the next one, that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be\\n\", 'So I proposed to topple the towers, throw the vertical into the horizontal and stack them up, and what looks a bit random from the side, if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter, you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid, in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up to create huge outdoor courtyards -- central spaces for the community, programmed with a variety of amenities and functions\\n', ' And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces\\n', \" They're open, permeable; they're interconnected\\n\", ' We called the project \"The Interlace,\" thinking that we interlace and interconnect the human beings and the spaces alike\\n', ' And the detailed quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants\\n', ' And, in fact, it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces, stacked to more and more individual and private spaces\\n', ' So we would open up a spectrum between the collective and the individual\\n', 'A little piece of math: if we count all the green that we left on the ground, minus the footprint of the buildings, and we would add back the green of all the terraces, we have 112 percent green space, so more nature than not having built a building\\n', ' And of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying the space available to those who live there\\n', ' So you see new datum planes, new grounds planes for social activity\\n', 'We paid a lot of attention to sustainability\\n', ' In the tropics, the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to, and, in fact, it is seeking protection from the sun\\n', ' We then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades to minimize the energy consumption of the building\\n', ' But most importantly, we could prove that through the geometry of the building design, the building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards so that those would be usable throughout the entire year\\n', ' And it was the idea of creating this variety of choices, of freedom to think where you would want to be, where you would want to escape, maybe, within the own complexity of the complex in which you live\\n', 'But coming from Asia to Europe: a building for a German media company based in Berlin, transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media\\n', ' And its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions: Why would anyone today still want to go to the office, because you can actually work anywhere? And how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building? We created not only an object, but at the center of this object we created a giant space, and this space was about the experience of a collective, the experience of collaboration and of togetherness\\n', ' Communication, interaction as the center of a space that in itself would float, like what we call the collaborative cloud, in the middle of the building, surrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices\\n', ' So with only a few steps from your quiet work desk, you could participate in the giant collective experience of the central space\\n', 'Finally, we come to London, a project commissioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation of the Mayor of London\\n', ' We were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in Stratford in the Olympic Park\\n', ' In the 19th century, Prince Albert had created Albertopolis\\n', ' And Boris Johnson thought of creating Olympicopolis\\n', \"The idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions, some international ones, and to create a new system of synergies\\n\", ' Prince Albert, as yet, created Albertopolis in the 19th century, thought of showcasing all achievements of mankind, bringing arts and science closer together\\n', \"But of course, today's society has moved on from there\\n\", ' We no longer live in a world in which everything is as clearly delineated or separated from each other\\n', ' We live in a world in which boundaries start to blur between the different domains, and in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important than keeping separations\\n', ' So we wanted to think of a giant culture machine, a building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains, but allow them to interact and collaborate\\n', ' At the base of it is a very simple module, a ring module\\n', ' It can be glazed over and turned into a giant exhibitional performance space\\n', ' These modules were stacked together with the idea that almost any function could, over time, occupy any of these modules\\n', ' So institutions could shrink or contract, as, of course, the future of culture is, in a way, the most uncertain of all\\n', ' This is how the building sits, adjacent to the Aquatics Centre, opposite the Olympic Stadium\\n', ' And you can see how its cantilevering volumes project out and engage the public space and how its courtyards animate the public inside\\n', 'The idea was to create a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity, in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume\\n', \" Here's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris\\n\", ' It both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project, but also the difference: here, it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure, in which different entities can interact without losing their own identity\\n', ' And it was this thought: to create an organizational structure that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted -- for those in the educational parts that create and think culture; for those that present the visual arts, the dance; and for the public to be admitted into all of this with a series of possible trajectories, to script their own reading of these narratives and their own experience\\n', 'And I want to end on a project that is very small, in a way, very different: a floating cinema in the ocean of Thailand\\n', ' Friends of mine had founded a film festival, and I thought, if we think of the stories and narratives of movies, we should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them\\n', ' So I designed a small modular floating platform, based on the techniques of local fishermen, how they built their lobster and fish farms\\n', ' We collaborated with the local community and built, out of recycled materials of their own, this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films from the British film archive, 1904 \"Alice in Wonderland,\" for example\\n', ' The most primordial experiences of the audience merged with the stories of the movies\\n', 'So I believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter, of the built environment, but is really about how we want to live our lives, how we script our own stories and those of others\\n', 'Thank you\\n', 'I once said, \"If you want to liberate a

climate change, population growth and competition for water resources threaten these vital lifelines and water resources\\n\", 'This figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead that happened in the last 15 years\\n', ' You can see starting around the year 2000, the lake level started to drop\\n', ' And it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry\\n', ' We like to complain about the navy showers we have to take\\n', ' We like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns\\n', \" But we've never really faced the prospect of turning on the tap and having nothing come out\\n\", \" And that's because when things have gotten bad in the past, it's always been possible to expand a reservoir or dig a few more groundwater wells\\n\", \" Well, in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for, it's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water\\n\", \" But that's an approach that's fraught with political, legal and social dangers\\n\", \" And even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors, we're just transferring the problem to someone else and there's a good chance it will come back and bite us in the form of higher food prices and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water\\n\", 'Now, if you told me 20 years ago that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water, I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer\\n', \" But my own experiences working with some of the world's most water-starved cities in the last decades have shown me that we have the technologies and the management skills to actually transition away from imported water, and that's what I want to tell you about tonight\\n\", ' One of the great tragedies of urban development is that as our cities grew, we started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt\\n', \" And when we did that, we had to build storm sewers to get the water that fell on the cities out before it could cause flooding, and that's a waste of a vital water resource\\n\", ' Let me give you an example\\n', 'This figure here shows you the volume of water that could be collected in the city of San Jose if they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits\\n', \" You can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line that if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city, they'd have enough water to get them through an entire year\\n\", 'Now, I know what some of you are probably thinking\\n', ' \"The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks and attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters, rainwater harvesting\\n', '\" Now, that\\'s an idea that might work in some places\\n', \" But if you live in a place where it mainly rains in the winter time and most of the water demand is in the summertime, it's not a very cost-effective way to solve a water problem\\n\", \" And if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought, like California's currently experiencing, you just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem\\n\", ' After all, many of our cities are sitting on top of a natural water storage system that can accommodate huge volumes of water\\n', 'For example, historically, Los Angeles has obtained about a third of its water supply from a massive aquifer that underlies the San Fernando Valley\\n', ' Now, when you look at the water that comes off of your roof and runs off of your lawn and flows down the gutter, you might say to yourself, \"Do I really want to drink that stuff?\" Well, the answer is you don\\'t want to drink it until it\\'s been treated a little bit\\n', ' And so the challenge that we face in urban water harvesting is to capture the water, clean the water and get it underground\\n', \"And that's exactly what the city of Los Angeles is doing with a new project that they're building in Burbank, California\\n\", \" This figure here shows the stormwater park that they're building by hooking a series of stormwater collection systems, or storm sewers, and routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry\\n\", \" The water that's captured in the quarry is slowly passed through a man-made wetland, and then it goes into that ball field there and percolates into the ground, recharging the drinking water aquifer of the city\\n\", 'And in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground, the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil, and that purifies the water\\n', \" And if the water's still not clean enough to drink after it's been through this natural treatment process, the city can treat it again when they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers before they deliver it to people to drink\\n\", ' Now, many of you are probably familiar with the concept of recycled water\\n', \" You've probably seen signs like this that tell you that the shrubbery and the highway median and the local golf course is being watered with water that used to be in a sewage treatment plant\\n\", \" We've been doing this for a couple of decades now\\n\", \" But what we're learning from our experience is that this approach is much more expensive that we expected it to be\\n\", ' And that becomes prohibitive in terms of cost\\n', \"What we're finding is that a much more cost-effective and practical way of recycling wastewater is to turn treated wastewater into drinking water through a two-step process\\n\", ' In the first step in this process we pressurize the water and pass it through a reverse osmosis membrane: a thin, permeable plastic membrane that allows water molecules to pass through but traps and retains the salts, the viruses and the organic chemicals that might be present in the wastewater\\n', 'In the second step in the process, we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and shine ultraviolet light on the water\\n', \"After the water's been through this two-stage process, it's safe to drink\\n\", \" I know, I've been studying recycled water using every measurement technique known to modern science for the past 15 years\\n\", \" We've detected some chemicals that can make it through the first step in the process, but by the time we get to the second step, the advanced oxidation process, we rarely see any chemicals present\\n\", \"There's another way we can recycle water\\n\", ' The treatment wetland receives water from a part of the Santa Ana River that in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent from cities like Riverside and San Bernardino\\n', \" The water comes into our treatment wetland, it's exposed to sunlight and algae and those break down the organic chemicals, remove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens\\n\", ' The water gets put back in the Santa Ana River, it flows down to Anaheim, gets taken out at Anaheim and percolated into the ground, and becomes the drinking water of the city of Anaheim, completing the trip from the sewers of Riverside County to the drinking water supply of Orange County\\n', ' Well, in California, we already recycle about 40 billion gallons a year of wastewater through the two-stage advanced treatment process I was telling you about\\n', \" That's enough water to be the supply of about a million people if it were their sole water supply\\n\", 'The third tap that we need to open up will not be a tap at all, it will be a kind of virtual tap, it will be the water conservation that we manage to do\\n', ' And the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors because in California and other modern American cities, about half of our water use happens outdoors\\n', \"In the current drought, we've seen that it's possible to have our lawns survive and our plants survive with about half as much water\\n\", ' We can have California-friendly landscaping with soil moisture detectors and smart irrigation controllers and have beautiful green landscapes in our cities\\n', 'The fourth and final water tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with desalinated seawater\\n', ' Now, I know what you probably heard people say about seawater desalination\\n', ' \"It\\'s a great thing to do if you have lots of oil, not a lot of water and you don\\'t care about climate change\\n', '\" Seawater desalination is energy-intensive no matter how you slice it\\n', ' But that characterization of seawater desalination as being a nonstarter is hopelessly out of date\\n', \" We've made tremendous progress in seawater desalination in the past two decades\\n\", \"This picture shows you the largest seawater desalination plant in the Western hemisphere that's currently being built north of San Diego\\n\", ' Compared to the seawater desalination plant that was built in Santa Barbara 25 years ago, this treatment plant will use about half the energy to produce a gallon of water\\n', \"But just because seawater desalination has become less energy-intensive, doesn't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere\\n\", \" Among the different choices we have, it's probably the most energy-intensive and potentially environmentally damaging of the options to create a local water supply\\n\", 'So there it is\\n', ' With these four sources of water, we can move away from our reliance on imported water\\n', ' Through reform in the way we landscape our surfaces and our properties, we can reduce outdoor water use by about 50 percent, thereby increasing the water supply by 25 percent\\n', ' We can recycle the water that makes it into the sewer, thereby increasing our water supply by 40 percent\\n', ' And we can make up the difference through a combination of stormwater harvesting and seawater desalination\\n', \" Let's create a water supply that uses local sources and leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food\\n\", \" Let's create a water system

architect and urban designer, and for the past year and a half, I've been looking at approaches to death and dying and at how they've shaped our cities and the buildings within them\\n\", 'So in the summer, I did my first exhibition on death and architecture in Venice, and it was called \"Death in Venice\\n', '\" And because death is a subject that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about, the exhibition was designed to be quite playful, so that people would literally engage with it\\n', ' So one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death\\n', ' As you wave your hand across the map, the name of the piece of real estate -- the building or the cemetery -- is revealed\\n', ' In fact, the majority are cemeteries\\n', 'So about half a million people die in the UK each year, and of those, around a quarter will want to be buried\\n', ' But the UK, like many Western European countries, is running out of burial space, especially in the major cities\\n', ' And the Greater London Authority has been aware of this for a while, and the main causes are population growth, the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full\\n', \" There's a custom in the UK that graves are considered to be occupied forever, and there's also development pressure -- people want to use that same land to build houses or offices or shops\\n\", 'So they came up with a few solutions\\n', ' They were like, well, maybe we can reuse those graves after 50 years\\n', ' Or maybe we can bury people, like, four deep, so that four people can be buried in the same plot, and we can make more efficient use of the land that way, and in that way, hopefully London will still have space to bury people in the near future\\n', \"But, traditionally, cemeteries haven't been taken care of by the local authority\\n\", \" In fact, the surprising thing is that there's no legal obligation on anyone in the UK to provide burial space\\n\", \" But there's also occasionally been a for-profit group who has wanted to get in on the act\\n\", \" And, you know, they look at the small size of a burial plot and that high cost, and it looks like there's serious money to be made\\n\", 'So, actually, if you want to go out and start your own cemetery, you kind of can\\n', ' There was this couple in South Wales, and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it, and they wanted to develop the land\\n', ' They first thought about making a caravan park, but the council said no\\n', ' Then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery and they calculated that by doing this, they could increase the value of their land from about 95,000 pounds to over one million pounds\\n', \"But just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries, like, it's kind of ludicrous, right? The thing is that the high cost of those burial plots is actually very misleading\\n\", \" They look like they're expensive, but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot -- like, someone has to cut the grass for the next 50 years\\n\", \" That means it's very difficult to make money from cemeteries\\n\", \" And it's the reason that normally they're run by the council or by a not-for-profit group\\n\", \" But anyway, the council granted these people permission, and they're now trying to build their cemetery\\n\", 'So just to explain to you kind of how this works: If I want to build something in the UK, like a cemetery for example, then I have to apply for planning permission first\\n', ' So if I want to build a new office building for a client or if I want to extend my home or, you know, if I have a shop and I want to convert it into an office, I have to do a load of drawings, and I submit them to the council for permission\\n', \" And they'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings\\n\", \" So they'll look at what it looks like\\n\", \" But they'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on the local environment?

But also good things\\n\", \" Is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood that local people would like to use?

your own mini-cemetery, then you can\\n', \" But the really weird thing is that you don't need to have a piece of land of a certain size before you're allowed to start burying people on it\\n\", ' And so that means that, technically, this applies to, like, the back garden of your house in the suburbs\\n', \"So, the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead -- you're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio\\n\", 'They also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is\\n', \" Now, they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this, but, legally speaking, there's almost nothing that they can do about it\\n\", ' And just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind about how much those burial plots cost and how much money you might be able to make, they also warn that it might cause the value of your house to drop by 20 percent\\n', \" Although, actually, it's more likely that no one will want to buy your house at all after that\\n\", ' And the reasons that people give \\n', \" you know, they think that their death is far off or they think that they're going to make people uncomfortable by talking about it\\n\", ' And you know, to a certain extent, there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us\\n', \" The government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things like burying a death, for example, and there's people like funeral directors who devote their entire working lives to this issue\\n\", \" But when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities, there's much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine\\n\", \"So we're not thinking about this, but all of the

alone\\n', \"The catch is that when this is happening to a new family, it is consuming, and a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable than they've ever been before, so that new mother

a tropical storm went by a few years ago\\n', ' And on the eastern end of the island, where the reefs are intact and thriving, you could barely tell a tropical storm had passed\\n', ' But in town, where corals had died from overfishing, from pollution, the tropical storm picked up the dead corals and used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left\\n', ' This is a coral that I studied during my PhD -- I got to know it quite well\\n', ' This magnification of threats, this compounding of factors is what Jeremy Jackson describes as the \"slippery slope to slime\\n', '\" It\\'s hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now are literally bacteria and algae and slime\\n', 'Now, this is the part of the talk where you may expect me to launch into my plea for us to all save the coral reefs\\n', ' But I have a confession to make: that phrase drives me nuts\\n', ' And yet, almost everyone I meet, no matter how educated, is not sure what a coral is or where they come from\\n', \" How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand? If they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from, or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is, why would we expect them to care about saving them?\\n\", \" What is a coral and where does it come from? Corals are born in a number of different ways, but most often by mass spawning: all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year, releasing all the eggs they've made that year into the water column, packaged into bundles with sperm cells\\n\", ' And those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart\\n', ' And hopefully -- hopefully -- at the surface of the ocean, they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals\\n', ' And that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef -- so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface\\n', \" When they're fertilized, they do what any other animal egg does: divides in half again and again and again\\n\", ' Taking these photos under the microscope every year is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year\\n', ' They can sense color and light, textures, chemicals, pH\\n', ' They can even feel pressure waves; they can hear sound\\n', ' And they use those talents to search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives\\n', 'So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life when you were just two days old\\n', \" They attach in the place they find most suitable, they build a skeleton underneath themselves, they build a mouth and tentacles, and then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs\\n\", ' One coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again, leaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself and growing up toward the sun\\n', ' Given hundreds of years and many species, what you get is a massive limestone structure that can be seen from space in many cases, covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals\\n', ' Now, there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000\\n', \" But these systems house millions and millions of other species, and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems, and it's where we're finding our new medicines\\n\", \" It's how we find new sources of food\\n\", \" I'm lucky enough to work on the island of Cura√ßao, where we still have reefs that look like this\\n\", ' But, indeed, much of the Caribbean and much of our world is much more like this\\n', \"Scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world's coral reefs, and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes\\n\", \" But in my research, I'm not interested in looking backward\\n\", ' My colleagues and I in Cura√ßao are interested in looking forward at what might be\\n', ' And we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic\\n', ' Because even in some of these reefs that we probably could have written off long ago, we sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway\\n', \" And we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't\\n\", ' They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet\\n', \" So in the research I do with my colleagues in Cura√ßao, we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage, what it's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process\\n\", \" I'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done to try to answer those questions\\n\", 'A few years ago we took a 3D printer and we made coral choice surveys -- different colors and different textures, and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle\\n', ' And we found that corals, even without the biology involved, still prefer white and pink, the colors of a healthy reef\\n', ' And they prefer crevices and grooves and holes, where they will be safe from being trampled or eaten by a predator\\n', ' So we can use this knowledge, we can go back and say we need to restore those factors -- that pink, that white, those crevices, those hard surfaces -- in our conservation projects\\n', \" We can also use that knowledge if we're going to put something underwater, like a sea wall or a pier\\n\", ' We can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back toward those corals\\n', ' Now in addition to the surfaces, we also study the chemical and microbial signals that attract corals to reefs\\n', ' Starting about six years ago, I began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled\\n', ' And I tried those one by one by one, looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach\\n', ' And we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer that will reliably cause corals to go through that settlement and attachment process\\n', \" So as we speak, my colleagues in Cura√ßao are testing those bacteria to see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab, and to see if those coral settlers will survive better when we put them back underwater\\n\", 'Now in addition to these tools, we also try to uncover the mysteries of species that are under-studied\\n', ' This is one of my favorite corals, and always has been: dendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral\\n', \" I love it because it makes this ridiculous shape, because its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy and because it's rare\\n\", ' Finding one of these on a reef is a treat\\n', \" In fact, it's so rare, that last year it was listed as a threatened species on the endangered species list\\n\", ' And this was in part because in over 30 years of research surveys, scientists had never found a baby pillar coral\\n', \" We weren't even sure if they could still reproduce, or if they were still reproducing\\n\", 'So four years ago, we started following these at night and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in Cura√ßao\\n', ' We got some good tips from our colleagues in Florida, who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008, and eventually we figured out when they spawn in Cura√ßao and we caught it\\n', \" And here's a male on the right, releasing sperm\\n\", \" Thanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles, and thanks to the 10 years of practice we've had in Cura√ßao at raising other coral species, we got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process and settle and attach, and turn into metamorphosed corals\\n\", ' So this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw\\n', 'And I have to say -- if you think baby pandas are cute, this is cuter\\n', \"So we're starting to figure out the secrets to this process, the secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them\\n\", ' And this is true all around the world; scientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos, to get them to settle, maybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures, so that we can preserve their genetic diversity and work with them more often\\n', ' But this is still so low-tech\\n', 'Now, compare that to our other crises and our other areas of concern as a society\\n', ' We have advanced medical technology, we have defense technology, we have scientific technology, we even have advanced technology for art\\n', ' But our technology for conservation is behind\\n', ' Think back to the most difficult job you ever did\\n', ' Many of you would say it was being a parent\\n', \" My mother described being a parent as something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult than you could've ever possibly imagined\\n\", \" I've been trying to help corals become parents for over 10 years now\\n\", ' And watching the wonder of life has certainly filled me with amazement to the core of my soul\\n', \" But I've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents\\n\", ' The pillar corals spawned again two weeks ago, and we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab\\n', \" They'll be infected with bacteria, they will explode and those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo that has a chance\\n\", \" We don't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don't know if it was just this coral on this reef, always suffering from low fertility\\n\", ' Whatever the cause, we have much more work to do before we can use baby corals to grow or fix or, yes, maybe save coral reefs\\n', \" They're providing us with art and food and medicine\\n\", ' And we almost took out an entire generation of corals\\n', \" But a few made it anyway, despite our best efforts, and now it's time for us to thank

message to be sent and received\\n', \" And after the moment of transmission, it's gone forever\\n\", ' Graphic communication, on the other hand, decouples that relationship\\n', 'Europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing in caves, rock shelters and even a few surviving open-air sites\\n', ' But this is not the Europe we know today\\n', ' This was a world dominated by towering ice sheets, three to four kilometers high, with sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra\\n', ' This was the Ice Age\\n', ' They provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imagination of these early artists\\n', \"Since their discovery, it's been the animals that have received the majority of the study like this black horse from Cullalvera in Spain, or this unusual purple bison from La Pasiega\\n\", ' But for me, it was the abstract shapes, what we call geometric signs, that drew me to study the art\\n', ' The funny this is that at most sites the geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images\\n', \" But when I started on this back in 2007, there wasn't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were, nor was there a strong sense of whether the same ones appeared across space or time\\n\", \" The problem was that while they were well documented at some sites, usually the ones with the very nice animals, there was also a large number of them where it was very vague -- there wasn't a lot of description or detail\\n\", \" Some of them hadn't been visited in half a century or more\\n\", ' These were the ones that I targeted for my field work\\n', 'Over the course of two years, my faithful husband Dylan and I each spent over 300 hours underground, hiking, crawling and wriggling around 52 sites in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily\\n', ' And it was totally worth it\\n', ' We found new, undocumented geometric signs at 75 percent of the sites we visited\\n', ' This is the level of accuracy I knew I was going to need if I wanted to start answering those larger questions\\n', \"So let's get to those answers\\n\", ' Barring a handful of outliers, there are only 32 geometric signs\\n', ' Only 32 signs across a 30,000-year time span and the entire continent of Europe\\n', ' That is a very small number\\n', ' But 65 percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period -- things like lines, rectangles triangles, ovals and circles like we see here from the end of the Ice Age, at a 10,000-year-old site high in the Pyrenees Mountains\\n', ' And while certain signs span thousands of kilometers, other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns, with some being limited to a single territory, like we see here with these divided rectangles that are only found in northern Spain, and which some researchers have speculated could be some sort of family or clan signs\\n', 'On a side note, there is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art found all the way from France and Spain to Indonesia and Australia\\n', \" With many of the same signs appearing in such far-flung places, especially in that 30,000 to 40,000-year range, it's starting to seem increasingly likely that this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in Africa\\n\", \" But that I'm afraid, is a subject for a future talk\\n\", 'So back to the matter at hand\\n', ' There could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators, like these 25,000-year-old bas-relief sculptures from La Roque de Venasque in France\\n', ' The repetition of the same signs, for so long, and at so many sites tells us that the artists were making intentional choices\\n', \" If we're talking about geometric shapes, with specific, culturally recognized, agreed-upon meanings, than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world\\n\", \" There's just not enough characters at this point to have represented all of the words in the spoken language, something which is a requirement for a full writing system\\n\", ' Nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet\\n', ' But what we do have are some intriguing one-offs, like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain, known as \"The Inscription,\" with its symmetrical markings on the left, possible stylized representations of hands in the middle, and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right\\n', 'The oldest systems of graphic communication in the world -- Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, the earliest Chinese script, all emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago, with each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem made up of counting marks and pictographic representations, where the meaning and the image were the same\\n', ' So a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal\\n', \" It's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized, until they almost become unrecognizable and that we also start to see more symbols being invented to represent all those other missing words in language -- things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives\\n\", 'So knowing all this, it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe were truly abstract written characters\\n', \" Instead, what's much more likely is that these early artists were also making counting marks, maybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily, as well as creating stylized representations of things from the world around them\\n\", ' Could some of the signs be weaponry or housing? Or what about celestial objects like star constellations? Or maybe even rivers, mountains, trees -- landscape features, possibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs from the site of El Castillo in Spain\\n', ' The term penniform means \"feather-shaped\" in Latin, but could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree? Some researchers have begun to ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites, but I believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole\\n', ' The irony in all of this, of course, is that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category, I have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart as different types of imagery are identified and separated off\\n', \"Now don't get me wrong, the later creation of fully developed writing was an impressive feat in its own right\\n\", \" But it's important to remember that those early writing systems didn't come out of a vacuum\\n\", 'Thank you\\n', \"Have you ever wondered what animals think and feel?

It's loneliness\\n\", \" According to government statistics, one person over 60 -- one in three -- doesn't speak to or see another person in a week\\n\", \" One person in 10, that's 850,000 people, doesn't speak to anyone else in a month\\n\", \" And we're not the only people with this problem; this problem touches the whole of the Western world\\n\", \" And it's even more acute in countries like China, where a process of rapid urbanization, mass migration, has left older people alone in the villages\\n\", \" And so the services that Beveridge designed and exported -- they can't address this kind of problem\\n\", \" Loneliness is like a collective relational challenge, and it can't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response\\n\", 'So some years ago, wanting to understand this problem, I started to work with a group of about 60 older people in South London, where I live\\n', ' I wanted to know what we could do differently\\n', ' And if you ask them, people tell you they want two things\\n', ' They want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb, or to be there when they come out of hospital\\n', ' They want on-demand, practical support\\n', ' And they want to have fun\\n', \" They want to go out, do interesting things with like-minded people, and make friends like we've all made friends at every stage of our lives\\n\", ' So we rented a phone line, hired a couple of handymen, and started a service we called \"Circle\\n', '\" And Circle offers its local membership a toll-free 0 800 number that they can call on demand for any support\\n', ' And people have called us for so many reasons\\n', \" They've called because their pets are unwell, their DVD is broken, they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone, or maybe they are coming out of hospital and they want someone to be there\\n\", ' And Circle also offers a rich social calendar -- knitting, darts, museum tours, hot air ballooning -- you name it\\n', \" But here's the interesting thing, the really deep change: over time, the friendships that have formed have begun to replace the practical offer\\n\", 'So let me tell you about Belinda\\n', \" Belinda's a Circle member, and she was going into hospital for a hip operation, so she called her local Circle to say they wouldn't see her for a bit\\n\", ' And Damon, who runs the local Circle, calls her back and says, \"How can I help?\" And Belinda says, \"Oh no, I\\'m fine -- Jocelyn is doing the shopping, Tony\\'s doing the gardening, Melissa and Joe are going to come in and cook and chat\\n', '\" So five Circle members had organized themselves to take care of Belinda\\n', \" And Belinda's 80, although she says that she feels 25 inside, but she also says that she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined Circle\\n\", ' But the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event led to a process where natural friendships formed, friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services\\n', 'So I think that three factors have converged that enable us to put relationships at the heart and center of how we solve social problems today\\n', \" Firstly, the nature of the problems -- they've changed, and they require different solutions\\n\", ' Secondly, the cost, human as much as financial, of doing business as usual\\n', ' And thirdly, technology\\n', \" It's technology that enables these approaches to scale and potentially now support thousands of people\\n\", \" So the technology we've used is really simple, it's made up of available things like databases, mobile phones\\n\", ' Circle has got this very simple system that underpins it, enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand\\n', \" And you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization of the 1970s, when this kind of scale just wasn't possible, neither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide\\n\", \"So it's relationships underpinned by technology that can turn the Beveridge models on their heads\\n\", ' The Beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources, anonymously managing access\\n', \" In my work at the front line, I've seen again and again how up to 80 percent of resource is spent keeping people out\\n\", ' So professionals have to administer these increasingly complex forms of administration that are basically about stopping people accessing the service or managing the queue\\n', ' And Circle, like the relational services that we and others have designed, inverts this logic\\n', ' What it says is, the more people, the more relationships, the stronger the solution\\n', ' So I want to tell you my third and final story, which is about unemployment\\n', ' In Britain, as in most places in the world, our welfare states were primarily designed to get people into work, to educate them for this, and to keep them healthy\\n', 'But guess how most people find work today? Through word of mouth\\n', ' It turns out that in Britain today, most new jobs are not advertised\\n', \" So it's friends that tell you about a job, it's friends that recommend you for a job, and it's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work\\n\", ' But not surprisingly, people who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network are those who are most isolated from it\\n', ' We designed a service that encourages people to meet up, people in and out of work, to work together in structured ways and try new opportunities\\n', \" And, well, it's very hard to compare the results of these new systems with the old transactional models, but it looks like, with our first 1,000 members, we outperformed existing services by a factor of three, at a fraction of the cost\\n\", \" And here, too, we've used technology, but not to network people in the way that a social platform would do\\n\", \" We've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other, building real relationships and supporting people to find work\\n\", 'At the end of his life, in 1948, Beveridge wrote a third report\\n', ' And in it he said he had made a dreadful mistake\\n', ' He had left people and their communities out\\n', ' And this omission, he said, led to seeing people, and people starting to see themselves, within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions\\n', ' And human relationships were already withering\\n', \" But unfortunately, this third report was much less read than Beveridge's earlier work\\n\", 'But today, we need to bring people and their communities back into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services, in an approach that I call \"Relational Welfare\\n', '\" We need to leave behind these old, transactional, unsuitable, outdated models, and we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses that can support a family like Ella\\'s, that can address an issue like loneliness, that can support people into work and up the skills curve in a modern labor market, that can also address challenges of education, of health care systems, and so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies\\n', ' It is all about relationships\\n', ' Relationships are the critical resource we have\\n', ' It is the continent hidden under the surface of the earth\\n', ' It is largely unexplored, poorly understood, and the stuff of legends\\n', ' But it is made also of dramatic landscapes like this huge underground chamber, and it is rich with surprising biological and mineralogical worlds\\n', \"Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers in the last three centuries -- actually, we know also thanks to satellite technology, of course -- we know almost every single square meter of our planet's surface\\n\", ' Because a cave landscape, like this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden, the potential of cave exploration -- the geographical dimension -- is poorly understood and unappreciated\\n', ' Because we are creatures living on the surface, our perception of the inner side of the planet is in some ways skewed, as is that of the depth of the oceans or of the upper atmosphere\\n', ' A single cave system, like Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky, can be as long as more than 600 kilometers\\n', ' And an abyss like Krubera Voronya, which is in the Caucasus region, actually the deepest cave explored in the world, can go as far as more than 2,000 meters below the surface\\n', ' That means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer\\n', ' So karstic regions are areas of the world where the infiltrating water along cracks, fractures, can easily dissolve soluble lithologies, forming a drainage system of tunnels, conduits -- a three-dimensional network, actually\\n', \" Karstic regions cover almost 20 percent of the continents' surface, and we know actually that speleologists in the last 50 years have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers of cave passages around the world, which is a big number\\n\", ' But geologists have estimated that what is still missing, to be discovered and mapped, is something around 10 million kilometers\\n', 'That means that for each meter of a cave that we already know, that we have explored, there are still some tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages\\n', ' That means that this is really an endless continent, and we will never be able to explore it completely\\n', ' And this estimation is made without considering other types of caves, like, for example, inside glaciers or even volcanic caves, which are not karstic, but are formed by lava flows\\n', ' And if we have a look at other planets like, for example, Mars, you will see that this characteristic is not so specific of our home planet\\n', \"I'm a speleologist, that means a cave explorer\\n\", ' And I started with this passion when I was really young in the mountains not far from my hometown in North Italy, in the karstic regions of the Alps and the Dolomites\\n', ' And in 2009, I had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains, which are in the Orinoco and Amazon basins\\n', ' These massifs enchanted me from the first time I saw them\\n', ' They are surrounded by vertical, vertiginous rock walls with silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest\\n', ' They really inspired in me a sense of wilderness, with a soul older than millions and millions of years\\n', ' And this dramatic landscape inspired among other things also Conan Doyle\\'s \"The Lost World\" novel in 1912\\n', ' Scientists consider those mountains as islands in time, being separated from the surrounding lowlands since tens of millions of years ago\\n', ' And, in fact, only a few of these mountains have been climbed and explored on their top\\n', ' So we do not expect at all to find a cave there\\n', ' Despite this, in the last 10 years, speleologists from Italy, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and, of course, Venezuela and Brazil, have explored several caves in this area\\n', ' So how can it be possible?\\n', 'To understand this contradiction, we have to consider the time factor, because the history of the tepuis is extremely long, starting about 1\\n', '6 billion years ago with the formation of the rock, and then evolving with the uplift of the region 150 million years ago, after the disruption of the Pangaea supercontinent and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean\\n', \" So you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years to sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis' surfaces, but also to open the fractures and form stone cities, rock cities, fields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of the tepuis\\n\", ' But nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame\\n', 'And so I was focusing in 2010 on one of those massifs, the Auy√°n-tepui, which is very famous because it hosts Angel Falls, which is the highest waterfall in the world -- about 979 meters of vertical drop\\n', ' And I was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems through satellite images, and finally we identified an area of collapses of the surface -- so, big boulders, rock piles -- and that means that there was a void below\\n', ' It was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain\\n', \" There are strong winds, and there are almost 4,000 millimeters of rainfall per year, so it's really, really difficult to find good conditions\\n\", 'The cave is huge\\n', \" It's a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau, and in only ten days of expedition, we explored more than 20 kilometers of cave passages\\n\", \" And it's a huge network of underground rivers, channels, big rooms, extremely deep shafts\\n\", \"So it's really an incredible place\\n\", ' And we named it Imawar√¨ Yeuta\\n', ' That means, in the Pem√≥n indigenous language, \"The House of the Gods\\n', '\" You have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there\\n', ' It was impossible for them to reach this area\\n', 'And the caves represent, really, a snapshot of the past\\n', ' What you can find there is really evidence of a lost world\\n', 'When you enter a quartzite cave, you have to completely forget what you know about caves -- classic limestone caves or the touristic caves that you can visit in several places in the world\\n', ' But you can find even stranger forms, like these mushrooms of silica growing on a boulder\\n', ' And you can imagine our talks when we were exploring the cave\\n', ' We were the first entering and discovering those unknown things, things like those monster eggs\\n', \" And we were a bit scared because it was all a discovery, and we didn't want to find a dinosaur\\n\", \" We didn't find a dinosaur\\n\", ' Stromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth\\n', ' And here in the tepuis, the interesting thing is that these bacteria colonies have evolved in complete isolation from the external surface, and without being in contact with humans\\n', ' They have never been in contact with humans\\n', ' So the implications for science are enormous, because here you could find, for example, microbes that could be useful to resolve diseases in medicine, or you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties\\n', ' And, in fact, we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science, which is rossiantonite, a phosphate-sulfate\\n', 'So whatever you find in the cave, even a small cricket, has evolved in the dark in complete isolation\\n', ' What seems only a dark, empty environment could be in reality a chest of wonders full of useful information\\n', 'With a team of Italian, Venezuelan and Brazilian speleologists, which is called La Venta Teraphosa, we will be back soon to Latin America, because we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the Amazon\\n', ' There are still very unknown mountains, like Marahuaca, which is almost 3,000 meters high above sea level, or Arac√†, which is in the upper region of Rio Negro in Brazil\\n', ' And we suppose that we could find there even bigger cave systems, and each one with its own undiscovered world\\n', 'Thank you\\n', \" Give me that to start so we don't forget\\n\", \" Francesco, you said we don't need to go to Mars to find alien life, and indeed, last time we spoke, you were in Sardinia and you were training European astronauts\\n\", ' So what do you, a speleologist, tell and teach to the astronauts?\\n', \" Yeah, we are -- it's a program of training for not only European, but also NASA, Roskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave\\n\", ' So they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation\\n', \" They have to work

switching on lightbulb\\n', ' And although it may seem inevitable, that what the public wants is watches and websites and widgets, maybe we could give a bit of thought to cork and light and hacky sacks\\n', 'Thank you very much\\n', 'A few years ago, with my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier, I invented a new technology for editing genomes\\n', \" It's called CRISPR-Cas9\\n\", 'You might be interested to know that the CRISPR technology came about through a basic research project that was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections\\n', ' Bacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment, and we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb -- a bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb before it gets destroyed\\n', ' So, many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called CRISPR, that allows them to detect viral DNA and destroy it\\n', ' Chinese scientists showed recently that they could even use the CRISPR technology to change genes in human embryos\\n', ' And scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR to remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus from infected human cells\\n', 'The opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider, because this technology can be employed not only in adult cells, but also in the embryos of organisms, including our own species\\n', \" And so, together with my colleagues, I've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co-invented, so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this\\n\", 'What I want to do now is tell you what the CRISPR technology is, what it can do, where we are today and why I think we need to take a prudent path forward in the way that we employ this technology\\n', ' And in a bacterium, the CRISPR system allows that DNA to be plucked out of the virus, and inserted in little bits into the chromosome -- the DNA of the bacterium\\n', ' And these integrated bits of viral DNA get inserted at a site called CRISPR\\n', ' \\n', 'A big mouthful -- you can see why we use the acronym CRISPR\\n', \" It's a mechanism that allows cells to record, over time, the viruses they have been exposed to\\n\", ' This allows the cells to keep a record of infection, and as my colleague, Blake Wiedenheft, likes to say, the CRISPR locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells\\n', ' Once those bits of DNA have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome, the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called RNA, which is orange in this picture, that is an exact replicate of the viral DNA\\n', ' RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA, and it allows interaction with DNA molecules that have a matching sequence\\n', ' It searches through all of the DNA in the cell, to find sites that match the sequences in the bound RNAs\\n', ' And when those sites are found -- as you can see here, the blue molecule is DNA -- this complex associates with that DNA and allows the Cas9 cleaver to cut up the viral DNA\\n', ' So we can think of the Cas9 RNA sentinel complex like a pair of scissors that can cut DNA -- it makes a double-stranded break in the DNA helix\\n', ' And importantly, this complex is programmable, so it can be programmed to recognize particular DNA sequences, and make a break in the DNA at that site\\n', \"As I'm going to tell you now, we recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering, to allow cells to make a very precise change to the DNA at the site where this break was introduced\\n\", \" That's sort of analogous to the way that we use a word-processing program to fix a typo in a document\\n\", 'The reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA and repair it\\n', ' So when a plant or an animal cell detects a double-stranded break in its DNA, it can fix that break, either by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA with a little, tiny change in the sequence of that position, or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut\\n', ' So if we have a way to introduce double-stranded breaks into DNA at precise places, we can trigger cells to repair those breaks, by either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information\\n', ' So if we were able to program the CRISPR technology to make a break in DNA at the position at or near a mutation causing cystic fibrosis, for example, we could trigger cells to repair that mutation\\n', \"Genome engineering is actually not new, it's been in development since the 1970s\\n\", \" We've had technologies for sequencing DNA, for copying DNA, and even for manipulating DNA\\n\", ' And these technologies were very promising, but the problem was that they were either inefficient, or they were difficult enough to use that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories, or certainly for many clinical applications\\n', ' So, the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal, because of its relative simplicity\\n', ' We can think of older genome engineering technologies as similar to having to rewire your computer each time you want to run a new piece of software, whereas the CRISPR technology is like software for the genome, we can program it easily, using these little bits of RNA\\n', \"So once a double-stranded break is made in DNA, we can induce repair, and thereby potentially achieve astounding things, like being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia or cause Huntington's Disease\\n\", \" I actually think that the first applications of the CRISPR technology are going to happen in the blood, where it's relatively easier to deliver this tool into cells, compared to solid tissues\\n\", \"Right now, a lot of the work that's going on applies to animal models of human disease, such as mice\\n\", \" The technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA affect either a tissue or, in this case, an entire organism\\n\", 'Now in this example, the CRISPR technology was used to disrupt a gene by making a tiny change in the DNA in a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice\\n', \" Imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome, and they're otherwise completely normal\\n\", ' And when we sequence the DNA from these animals, we find that the change in the DNA has occurred at exactly the place where we induced it, using the CRISPR technology\\n', 'Additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease, such as monkeys\\n', ' And here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues, for

400 prisoners in US prisons who are classified as terrorists, and only a handful of them are in the CMUs\\n', \" In McGowan's case, he was previously at a low-security prison and he had no

about potentially your own cells\\n\", ' Absolutely\\n', \" And there's no perhaps\\n\", \" This is what we're doing\\n\", ' Thank you so much\\n', ' Pleasure\\n', ' Thanks\\n', \"Over our lifetimes, we've all contributed to climate change\\n\", ' Actions, choices and behaviors will have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions\\n', \" And I think that that's quite a powerful thought\\n\", ' But it does have the potential to make us feel guilty when we think about decisions we might have made around where to travel to, how often and how, about the energy that we choose to use in our homes or in our workplaces, or quite simply the lifestyles that we lead and enjoy\\n', \" But we can also turn that thought on its head, and think that if we've had such a profound but a negative impact on our climate already, then we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change that we will need to adapt to\\n\", 'So we have a choice\\n', ' We can either choose to start to take climate change seriously, and significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, and then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future\\n', ' Alternatively, we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem\\n', ' And not only that\\n', \" As people who live in countries with high per capita emissions, we're making that choice on behalf of others as well\\n\", \" But the choice that we don't have is a no climate change future\\n\", \"Over the last two decades, our government negotiators and policymakers have been coming together to discuss climate change, and they've been focused on avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming above pre-industrial levels\\n\", \" That's the temperature that's associated with dangerous impacts across a range of different indicators, to humans and to the environment\\n\", ' So two degrees centigrade constitutes dangerous climate change\\n', 'But dangerous climate change can be subjective\\n', ' So if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world, and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure, where there are people that are well-insured and so on, then that impact can be disruptive\\n', ' It can cause upset, it could cause cost\\n', ' It could even cause some deaths\\n', \" But if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world where there is poor infrastructure, or where people are not well-insured, or they're not having good support networks, then that same climate change impact could be devastating\\n\", ' It could cause a significant loss of home, but it could also cause significant amounts of death\\n', 'So this is a graph of the CO2 emissions at the left-hand side from fossil fuel and industry, and time from before the Industrial Revolution out towards the present day\\n', \" And what's immediately striking about this is that emissions have been growing exponentially\\n\", ' And then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event\\n', ' And if we focus on our historical emission trend in recent years, and we put that together with our understanding of the direction of travel in our global economy, then we are much more on track for a four-degree centigrade global warming than we are for the two-degree centigrade\\n', \"Now, let's just pause for a moment and think about this four-degree global average temperature\\n\", ' Most of our planet is actually made up of the sea\\n', ' Now, because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land, the average temperatures over land are actually going to be higher than they are over the sea\\n', \" The second thing is that we as human beings don't experience global average temperatures\\n\", ' We experience hot days, cold days, rainy days, especially if you live in Manchester like me\\n', 'So now put yourself in a city center\\n', ' Imagine somewhere in the world: Mumbai, Beijing, New York, London\\n', \" It's the hottest day that you've ever experienced\\n\", \" There's sun beating down, there's concrete and glass all around you\\n\", ' So our roads and our rail networks have been designed to last for a long time and withstand only certain amounts of impacts in different parts of the world\\n', ' And this is going to be extremely challenged\\n', ' Our power stations are expected to be cooled by water to a certain temperature to remain effective and resilient\\n', ' And our buildings are designed to be comfortable within a particular temperature range\\n', ' And this is all going to be significantly challenged under a four-degree-type scenario\\n', ' Our infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this\\n', \"So if we go back, also thinking about four degrees, it's not just the direct impacts, but also some indirect impacts\\n\", ' So if we take food security, for example\\n', ' Maize and wheat yields in some parts of the world are expected to be up to 40 percent lower under a four-degree scenario, rice up to 30 percent lower\\n', ' So all in all, the kinds of impacts anticipated under this four-degree centigrade scenario are going to be incompatible with global organized living\\n', 'So back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees\\n', ' But I would just like to draw on my own research on energy systems, on food systems, aviation and also shipping, just to say that I think there is still a small fighting chance of avoiding this two-degree dangerous climate change\\n', 'So if you focus in on this trajectory and these graphs, the yellow circle there highlights that the departure from the red four-degree pathway to the two-degree green pathway is immediate\\n', \" And that's because of cumulative emissions, or the carbon budget\\n\", ' So in other words, because of the lights and the projectors that are on in this room right now, the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere as a result of that electricity consumption lasts a very long time\\n', ' It will accumulate, and greenhouse gases tend to be cumulative\\n', ' And that tells us something about these trajectories\\n', \" First of all, it tells us that it's the area under these curves that matter, not where we reach at a particular date in future\\n\", \" And that's important, because it doesn't matter if we come up with some amazing whiz-bang technology to sort out our energy problem on the last day of 2049, just in the nick of time to sort things out\\n\", ' Because in the meantime, emissions will have accumulated\\n', ' So if we continue on this red, four-degree centigrade scenario pathway, the longer we continue on it, that will need to be made up for in later years to keep the same carbon budget, to keep the same area under the curve, which means that that trajectory, the red one there, becomes steeper\\n', \" So in other words, if we don't reduce emissions in the short to medium term, then we'll have to make more significant year-on-year emission reductions\\n\", ' We also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system\\n', \" But if we don't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term, then we will have to do that even sooner\\n\", 'The other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy\\n', \" So it doesn't matter whether we choose nuclear power or carbon capture and storage, upscale our biofuel production, or go for a much bigger roll-out of wind turbines and wave turbines\\n\", ' All of that will take time\\n', \" And if we do that, that also means that as we continue to roll out the supply-side technology, we will have less of a job to do if we've actually managed to reduce our energy consumption, because we will then need less infrastructure on the supply side\\n\", 'Another issue that we really need to grapple with is the issue of well-being and equity\\n', ' There are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise\\n', ' Bbut with energy systems currently reliant on fossil fuel, as those economies grow so will emissions\\n', \" And now, if we're all constrained by the same amount of carbon budget, that means that if some parts of the world's emissions are needing to rise, then other parts of the world's emissions need to reduce\\n\", \" Because according to our research, if you're in a country where per capita emissions are really high -- so North America, Europe, Australia -- emissions reductions of the order of 10 percent per year, and starting immediately, will be required for a good chance of avoiding the two-degree target\\n\", ' Let me just put that into context\\n', ' The economist Nicholas Stern said that emission reductions of more than one percent per year had only ever been associated with economic recession or upheaval\\n', ' So this poses huge challenges for the issue of economic growth, because if we have our high carbon infrastructure in place, it means that if our economies grow, then so do our emissions\\n', \" So I'd just like to take a quote from a paper by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011 where we said that to avoid the two-degree framing of dangerous climate change, economic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily for a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations\\n\", 'This is a really difficult message to take, because what it suggests is that we really need to do things differently\\n', ' This is not about just incremental change\\n', \" This is about doing things differently, about whole system change, and sometimes it's about doing less things\\n\", ' So it could be from writing to our local politician to talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work, or talking with our friends and family, or, quite simply, changing our lifestyles\\n', \" At the moment, we're choosing a four-degree scenario\\n\", ' If we really want to avoid the two-degree scenario, there really is no time like the present to act\\n', 'Thank you\\n', \" Alice, basically what you're saying, the talk is, unless wealthy nations start cutting 10 percent per year the emissions now, this year, not in 2020 or '25, we are going to go straight to the four-plus-degree scenario\\n\", ' So they make kind of heroic assumptions about that\\n', \" The more we do that, because it's the cumulative emissions, the short-term stuff that really matters\\n\", ' So it does make a huge difference\\n', ' If a big country like China, for example, continues to grow even for just a few extra years, that will make a big difference to when we need to decarbonize\\n', \" So I don't think we can even say when it will be, because it all depends on what we have to do in the short term\\n\", \" But I think we've just got huge scope, and we don't pull those levers that allow us to reduce the energy demand, which is a shame\\n\", ' Alice, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this data\\n', ' Thank you\\n', 'Raise your hand if you\\'ve ever been

billion people, about 3 billion are left behind\\n', ' 1\\n', \"3 billion don't have access to electricity, and they light their homes with kerosene and candles, both of which are dangerous\\n\", '

deaths a year from indoor smoke inhalation, and of course, most of those who die are women\\n', ' So we have a very unequal world, and we need to change from \"business as usual\\n', '\" And we shouldn\\'t underestimate the scale and the transformative nature of the change which will be needed, because we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about 2050, if we\\'re going to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming\\n', ' And that means we have to leave about two-thirds of the known resources of fossil fuels in the ground\\n', \"It's a very big change, and it means that obviously, industrialized countries must cut their emissions, must become much more energy-efficient, and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy\\n\", ' For developing countries and emerging economies, the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions, because they must develop; they have very poor populations\\n', ' Indeed, no country in the world has actually grown without emissions\\n', ' All the countries have developed with fossil fuels, and then may be moving to renewable energy\\n', ' So it is a very big challenge, and it requires the total support of the international community, with the necessary finance and technology, and systems and support, because no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change\\n', ' Human solidarity, if you like, based on self-interest -- because we are all in this together, and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon by 2050\\n', \"The good news is that change is happening, and it's happening very fast\\n\", \" Here in California, there's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions\\n\", \" In Hawaii, they're passing legislation to have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045\\n\", ' And governments are very ambitious around the world\\n', ' In Ethiopia, the commitment is to be carbon-neutral by 2027\\n', ' Apple have pledged that their factories in China will use renewable energy\\n', ' And there is a race on at the moment to convert electricity from tidal and wave power, in order that we can leave the coal in the ground\\n', ' And that change is both welcome

could be able to live on their island and have a solution, but it would take a lot of political will\\n', ' President Tong told me about his ambitious idea to either build up or even float the little islands where his people live\\n', ' This, of course, is beyond the resources of Kiribati itself\\n', ' It would require great solidarity and support from other countries, and it would require the kind of imaginative idea that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air\\n', ' Yes, the challenges of the transformation we need are big, but they can be solved\\n', ' We are actually, as a people, very capable of coming together to solve problems\\n', ' It was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almost insoluble problems -- the devastation of the world wars, particularly the Second World War; the fragile peace that had been brought about; the need for a whole economic regeneration\\n', \" But the leaders of that time didn't flinch from this\\n\", ' They had the capacity, they had a sense of being driven by never again must the world have this kind of problem\\n', ' A Marshall Plan for Europe, a devastated Europe, to reconstruct it\\n', ' And indeed a few years later, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\\n', '2015 is a year that is similar in its importance to 1945, with similar challenges and similar potential\\n', ' There will be two big summits this year: the first one, in September in New York, is the summit for the sustainable development goals\\n', ' And then the summit in Paris in December, to give us a climate agreement\\n', ' The sustainable development goals are intended to help countries to live sustainably, in tune with Mother Earth, not to take out of Mother Earth and destroy ecosystems, but rather, to live in harmony with Mother Earth, by living under sustainable development\\n', ' So we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed, so that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions, and how we move more rapidly to renewable energy, so that we have a safe world\\n', \"It's an issue for all of us, and it's an issue where we need more and more momentum\\n\", ' Indeed, the face of the environmentalist has changed, because of the justice dimension\\n', \" It's now an issue for faith-based organizations, under very good leadership from Pope Francis, and indeed, the Church of England, which is divesting from fossil fuels\\n\", \" It's an issue for the business community, and the good news is that the business community is changing very rapidly -- except for the fossil fuel industries --\\n\", 'Even they are beginning to slightly change their language -- but only slightly\\n', ' But business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable energy, but is urging politicians to give them more signals, so that they can move even more rapidly\\n', \" It's an issue for the trade union movement\\n\", \" It's an issue for the women's movement\\n\", \" It's an issue for young people\\n\", 'I was very struck when I learned that Jibreel Khazan, one of the Greensboro Four who had taken part in the Woolworth sit-ins, said quite recently that climate change is the lunch counter moment for young people\\n', ' So, lunch counter moment for young people of the 21st century -- the sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century, because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world\\n', 'I recall very much the Climate March last September, and that was a huge momentum, not just in New York, but all around the world\\n', ' and we have to build on that\\n', ' I was marching with some of The Elders family, and I saw a placard a little bit away from me, but we were wedged so closely together -- because after all, there were 400,000 people out in the streets of New York -- so I couldn\\'t quite get to that placard, I would have just liked to have been able to step behind it, because it said, \"Angry Grannies!\"\\n', \" We know that inevitably it will be a climate-constrained world, because of the emissions we've already put up there, but it could be a world that is much more equal and much fairer, and much better for health, and better for jobs and better for energy security, than the world we have now, if we have switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy, and no one is left behind\\n\", ' No one is left behind\\n', 'And just as we\\'ve been looking back this year -- in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years -- I would like to think that they will look back, that world will look back 35 years from 2050, 35 years to 2015, and that they will say, \"Weren\\'t they good to do what they did in 2015? We really appreciate that they took the decisions that made a difference, and that put the world on the right pathway, and we benefit now from that pathway,\" that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities, we did what was done in 1945 in similar terms, we didn\\'t miss the opportunity, we lived up to our responsibilities\\n', \" That's what this year is about\\n\", \"And somehow for me, it's captured in words of somebody that I admired very much\\n\", ' She was a mentor of mine, she was a friend, she died much too young, she was an extraordinary personality, a great champion of the environment: Wangari Maathai\\n', ' Wangari said once, \"In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach a higher moral ground\\n', '\" And that\\'s what we have to do\\n', ' We have to reach a new level of consciousness, a higher moral ground\\n', ' And we have to do it this year in those two big summits\\n', '

were barbaric, but if we think they were archaic, from a remote, obscure age, then we're wrong\\n\", ' They were uniquely modern, because the murderers acted knowing well that millions of people would tune in to watch\\n', 'The headlines called them savages and barbarians, because the image of one man overpowering another, killing him with a knife to the throat, conforms to our idea of ancient, primitive practices, the polar opposite of our urban, civilized ways\\n', \" We don't do things like that\\n\", \" But that's the irony\\n\", ' We think a beheading has nothing to do with us, even as

\" He told reporters 18 months later that it had been downloaded many millions of times, and that's just one website\\n\", ' A similar pattern was seen again and again when videos of beheadings were released during the Iraq War\\n', \"Social media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before, but if we take another step back in history, we'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd in our history of beheadings as public spectacle\\n\", ' As soon as the camera appeared on the scene, a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939, it had an immediate and unequivocal effect\\n', ' It was the execution, the guillotining, of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann, outside the prison Saint-Pierre in Versailles\\n', \" Weidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn, as was customary at the time, but his executioner was new to the job, and he'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare\\n\", ' So Weidmann was executed at 4:30 in the morning, by which time on a June morning, there was enough light to take photographs, and a spectator in the crowd filmed the event, unbeknownst to the authorities\\n', ' The crowd on the day of Weidmann\\'s execution was called \"unruly\" and \"disgusting\" by the press, but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again, freeze-framed in every detail\\n', \"The camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before, but it's not just about the camera\\n\", ' There could be 40,000 or 50,000 to see a famous criminal killed\\n', ' And a beheading, which was a rare event in England at the time, attracted even more\\n', 'In May 1820, five men known as the Cato Street Conspirators were executed in London for plotting to assassinate members of the British government\\n', ' They were hung and then decapitated\\n', ' It was a gruesome scene\\n', \" Each man's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the

throughout our history of public beheadings and public executions, the vast majority of the people who come to see are either enthusiastic or, at best, unmoved\\n', \" Disgust has been comparatively rare, and even when people are disgusted and are horrified, it doesn't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch\\n\", 'Perhaps the most striking example of the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved and even be disappointed was the introduction in France in 1792 of the guillotine, that famous decapitation machine\\n', ' To us in the 21st century, the guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption, but to the first crowds who saw it, it was actually a disappointment\\n', ' They were used to seeing long, drawn-out, torturous executions on the scaffold, where people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly\\n', ' To them, watching the guillotine in action, it was so quick, there was nothing to see\\n', '\"\\n', 'The end of torturous public judicial executions in Europe and America was partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal, but it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave in the way that they

thousands of instruments\\n', ' This is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project, where you can see 10,000 neurons and 30 million connections\\n', ' We can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge\\n', 'These are some remarkable trees of knowledge, or trees of science, by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull\\n', '\" But perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge, at least for me, was created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d\\'Alembert in 1751\\n', ' This was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment, and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia\\n', ' And it actually maps out all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree\\n', 'But knowledge is much more intricate than this\\n', ' These are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter-linkage of articles -- related to history on the left, and mathematics on the right\\n', ' And I think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of Wikipedia -- arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man -- we can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate and interdependent, just like a network\\n', 'We can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people\\n', ' This is the typical organization chart\\n', \" I'm assuming many of

decentralized process -- there's no leader in this organization, it's a network\\n\", 'We can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism\\n', ' The diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in 2004\\n', ' And what they did here is, they actually segmented the network into three different years, represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me\\n', ' And the blue lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year\\n', \" So even though there's no leader per se, these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization, the ones that know more about the past, and the future plans and goals of this particular cell\\n\", '\" There\\'s actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher, expanding on the importance of this particular diagram\\n', \" It was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution\\n\", ' But recently, scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life is a dense network of bacteria, and these bacteria are actually tying together species that were completely separated before, to what scientists are now calling not the tree of life, but the web of life, the network of life\\n', 'And finally, we can really see this shift, again, when we look at ecosystems around our planet\\n', ' No more do we have these simplified predator-versus-prey diagrams we have all learned at school\\n', ' This is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem\\n', ' This is a diagram created by Professor David Lavigne, mapping close to 100 species that interact with the codfish off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada\\n', ' And I think here, we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature of most ecosystems that abound on our planet\\n', \" It's almost becoming the syntax of a new language\\n\", ' And this is one aspect that truly fascinates me\\n', ' And here is an example\\n', ' On the very top band, you have radial convergence, a

As designers, researchers, and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems, they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields, like painting and sculpture, and influencing many different artists\\n', ' And perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them -- they\\'re immensely gorgeous -- they are really becoming a cultural meme, and driving a new art movement, which I\\'ve called \"networkism\\n', '\" And we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways\\n', ' This is just one of many examples, where you can see this influence from science into art\\n', ' The example on your left side is IP-mapping, a computer-generated map of IP addresses; again -- servers, machines\\n', ' And here are a few more paintings by Sharon Molloy, some gorgeous, intricate paintings\\n', \"And here's another example of that interesting cross-pollination between science and art\\n\", ' On your left side, you have \"Operation Smile\\n', ' And on your right side,

really notice the influence from traditional network visualization\\n', \"But networkism doesn't happen only in two dimensions\\n\", ' This is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement\\n', '\" And I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful\\n', ' It was created by Tom√°s Saraceno, and he occupies these large spaces, creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes\\n', ' As you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes, the entire network kind of shifts, almost like a real organic network would\\n', \"And here's yet another example of networkism taken to a whole different level\\n\", ' This was created by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota in a piece called \"In Silence\\n', '\" And Chiharu, like Tom√°s Saraceno, fills these rooms with this dense network, this dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread, sometimes including objects, as you can see here, sometimes even including people, in many of her installations\\n', ' Networks really embody notions of decentralization, of interconnectedness, of interdependence\\n', ' And this new way of thinking is critical for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays, from decoding the human brain, to understanding the vast universe out there\\n', ' On your left side, you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse -- very similar to our own at this particular scale\\n', ' And on your right side, you have the Millennium Simulation\\n', ' It was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure\\n', ' It was able to recreate the history of 20 million galaxies in approximately 25 terabytes of output\\n', ' And coincidentally or not, I just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge -- the brain -- and the largest scale of knowledge -- the universe itself -- to be really quite striking and fascinating\\n', ' Because as Bruce Mau once said, \"When

big-time opponents, like Everett \"The Blonde Bear\" Marshall, or three-time world champion, Angelo Savoldi\\n', \" One night, The Terrible Turk's big toe scratched a scar like Capone's down the side of his face\\n\", ' Twice Bonica showed up to the O\\n', \" with one eye so bruised, he couldn't see out of it\\n\", ' But worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears\\n', ' He said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head\\n', ' Pain just kept accumulating in his life\\n', 'Next, he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital\\n', ' She heaved and pushed, clearly in anguish\\n', ' Her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain\\n', \" But the intern was a young guy, just three weeks on the job -- he was jittery, and in applying the ether, irritated Emma's throat\\n\", ' Bonica, who was watching all this, pushed the intern out of the way, cleared her airway, and saved his wife and his unborn daughter\\n', \" Later, he'd even go on to help develop the epidural, for delivering mothers\\n\", ' But before he could focus on obstetrics, Bonica had to report for basic training\\n', 'Right around D-Day, Bonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center, near Tacoma\\n', ' At 7,700 beds, it was one of the largest army hospitals in America\\n', ' Bonica was in charge of all pain control there\\n', ' He was only 27\\n', ' Treating so many patients, Bonica started noticing cases that contradicted everything he had learned\\n', \" Pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell -- in a good way -- a body's way of signaling an injury, like a broken arm\\n\", ' But in some cases, like after a patient had a leg amputated, that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg\\n', ' But if the injury had been treated, why would the alarm bell keep ringing? There were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever, and yet, still the patient hurt\\n', 'Bonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital -- surgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists, others\\n', ' And he tried to get their opinions on his patients\\n', ' It took too long, so he started organizing group meetings over lunch\\n', \" It would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient's pain\\n\", ' No one had ever focused on pain this way before\\n', 'After that, he hit the books\\n', ' He read every medical textbook he could get his hands on, carefully noting every mention of the word \"pain\\n', '\" Out of the 14,000 pages he read, the word \"pain\" was on 17 and a half of them\\n', ' For the most basic, most common, most frustrating part of being a patient\\n', ' Bonica was shocked -- I\\'m quoting him, he said, \"What the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there? The most important thing from the patient\\'s perspective, they don\\'t talk about\\n', 'So over the next eight years, Bonica would talk about it\\n', \" He'd write about it; he'd write those missing pages\\n\", ' He wrote what would later be known as the Bible of Pain\\n', ' In it he proposed new strategies, new treatments using nerve-block injections\\n', ' He proposed a new institution, the Pain Clinic, based on those lunchtime meetings\\n', \" A desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously in patients' lives\\n\", ' He recast the very purpose of medicine\\n', \" The goal wasn't to make patients better; it was to make patients feel better\\n\", \" He pushed his pain agenda for decades, before it finally took hold in the mid-'70s\\n\", ' Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world\\n', 'But as they did -- a tragic twist\\n', \" Bonica's years of wrestling caught up to him\\n\", ' Still in his mid-50s, he suffered severe osteoarthritis\\n', \" Over the next 20 years he'd have 22 surgeries, including four spine operations, and hip replacement after hip replacement\\n\", ' He needed aluminum crutches to walk\\n', ' His friends and former students became his doctors\\n', ' One recalled that he probably had more nerve-block injections than anyone else on the planet\\n', ' Already a workaholic, he worked even more -- 15- to 18-hour days\\n', ' Healing others became more than just his job, it was his own most effective form of relief\\n', ' \"If I wasn\\'t as busy as I am,\" he told a reporter at the time, \"I would be a completely disabled guy\\n', '\"\\n', ' They drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion, with giant silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage\\n', ' Decades earlier, Bonica had watched them, clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles, doing the act they pioneered -- the Human Cannonball\\n', \" That generation is all dead now, including Bonica, so there's no way to know exactly what they said that day\\n\", ' Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice\\n', 'Bonica saw pain close up\\n', ' He felt it\\n', ' He lived it\\n', ' Out of that empathy, he spun a whole new field, played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself\\n', 'In that same oral history, Bonica claimed that pain is the most complex human experience\\n', ' That it involves your past life, your current life, your interactions, your family\\n', ' That was definitely true for Bonica\\n', \" It's easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of professional patient, a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms\\n\", ' Sometimes I get stuck seeing her that same way\\n', \" Before they got swollen and arthritic, my mom's fingers clacked away in the hospital H\\n\", 'R\\n', ' They folded samosas for our entire mosque\\n', ' When I was a kid, they cut my hair, wiped my nose, tied my shoes\\n', 'As a matter of fact, I was trying to think about my career since I left the White House, and the best example I have is a cartoon in The New Yorker a couple of years ago\\n', ' This little boy is looking up at his father, and he says, \"Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be a former president\\n', 'Well, I have had a great blessing as a former president, because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe\\n', ' And a lot of times, when we go into a country, we not only the meet the king or the president, but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa\\n', 'So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights, and knowing the world as I do, I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is, strangely, not addressed quite often, is the abuse of women and girls\\n', \"There are a couple of reasons for this that I'll mention to begin with\\n\", ' First of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures, holy scriptures, in the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, Quran and so forth, and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques\\n', ' And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God\\n', 'This is a very serious problem\\n', \" It's ordinarily not addressed\\n\", \" A number of years ago, in the year 2000, I had been a Baptist, a Southern Baptist for 70 years -- I tell you, I still teach Sunday school every Sunday; I'll be teaching this Sunday as well -- but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year 2000 decided that women should play a secondary position, a subservient position to men\\n\", \" So they issued an edict, in effect, that prevents women from being priests, pastors, deacons in the church, or chaplains in the military, and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary, they cannot teach if a boy is in the room, because you can find verses in the Bible, there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible, that say that a woman shouldn't teach a man, and so forth\\n\", ' But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position\\n', 'The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence, and that is increasing tremendously around the world\\n', ' In the United States of America, for instance, we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people, mostly black people and minorities, by putting them in prison\\n', ' Nowadays, 7\\n', '3 people per 1,000 are in prison\\n', \" That's a sevenfold increase\\n\", \" And since I left the White House, there's been an 800 percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison\\n\", ' We also have [one of the only countries] on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country\\n', ' And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty\\n', \" We're in California now, and I figured out the other day that California has spent four billion dollars in convicting 13 people for the death penalty\\n\", \" If you add that up, that's 307 million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed\\n\", '  So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women\\n', \"Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most, and I'll be fairly brief, because I have a limited amount of time, as you know\\n\", 'One is genital mutilation\\n', \" Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women, but in some countries, many countries, when a child is born that's a girl, very soon in her life, her genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and, in a non-sterilized way, they remove the exterior parts of a woman's genitalia\\n\", ' And sometimes, in more extreme cases but not very rare cases, they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate\\n', ' And then later, when she gets married, the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex\\n', ' In Egypt, for instance, 91 percent of all the females that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way\\n', \" In some countries, it's more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity\\n\", ' This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries\\n', ' And this is done by members of her own family, so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so-called disgrace to the family\\n', ' An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father, the uncle or the brother, but 25 percent of the murders are conducted by women\\n', \"Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery, or human trafficking it's called nowadays\\n\", '5 million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century\\n', ' There are 30 million people now living in slavery\\n', ' In the United States right this moment, 60,000 people are living in human bondage, or slavery\\n', ' Atlanta, Georgia, where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University, they have between 200 and 300 women, people sold into slavery every month\\n', \" It's the number one place in the nation because of that\\n\", ' Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world, and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere\\n', ' A white-skinned girl brings several times more than that, and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about $35,000 per slave\\n', ' The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia\\n', \" So this is another very serious problem, and the basic problem is prostitution, because there's not a whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials, the local policemen, or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth\\n\", 'And this leads to one of the worst problems, and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world\\n', 'Sweden has got a good approach to it\\n', ' About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law, and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery, but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted, and --  -- prostitution has gone down\\n', ' In the United States, we take just the opposite position\\n', ' For every male arrested for illegal sex trade, 25 women are arrested in the United States of America\\n', \" Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden, France, and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model\\n\", \" That's another thing that can be done\\n\", 'We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire: our military and our great university system\\n', ' In the military, they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place\\n', ' The last report I got, there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military -- 26,000\\n', ' Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent, are actually prosecuted, and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization -- a ship like my submarine, or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines -- the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not, and of course, the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command, sexual assaults are taking place, so they do not do it\\n', ' That law needs to be changed\\n', 'About one out of four girls who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates, and this is now getting a lot of publicity, partially because of my book, but other things, and so 89 universities in America are now condemned by the Department of Education under Title IX because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault\\n', \" The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists, because outside of the university system, if they rape somebody, they'll be prosecuted, but when they get on a university campus, they can rape with impunity\\n\", \" They're not prosecuted\\n\", \"Another thing that's very serious about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work, as you know\\n\", '  And this is sometimes misinterpreted, but for full-time employment, a woman in the United States now gets 23 percent less than a man\\n', ' When I became president, the difference was 39 percent\\n', \" So we've made some progress, partially because I was president and so forth --   -- but in the last 15 years, there's been no progress made, so it's been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years\\n\", ' If you take the Fortune 500 companies, 23 of them have women CEOs, out of 500, and those CEOs, I need not tell you, make less on an average than the other CEOs\\n', \" Well, that's what goes on in our country\\n\", 'Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth\\n', ' We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the Second World War\\n', \" Sometimes, we've had soldiers on the ground fighting\\n\", \" The other times, we've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people\\n\", ' Other times, of course, now, we have drones that attack people and so forth\\n', \" We've been at war with 25 different countries or more since the Second World War\\n\", \" There was four years, I won't say which ones, where we didn't --  -- we didn't drop a bomb, we didn't launch a missile, we didn't fire a bullet\\n\", ' But anyway, those kinds of things, the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes, are the basic causes, of abuse of women and girls\\n', \"There's one more basic cause that I need not mention, and that is that in general, men don't give a damn\\n\", \" The average man that might say, I'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy, and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child, when separate but equal had existed\\n\", ' Racial discrimination, legally, had existed for 100 years, from 1865 at the end of the War Between the States, the Civil War, all the way up to the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights\\n', ' Even though they say, \"I\\'m against discrimination against girls and women,\" they enjoy a privileged position\\n', \" And it's very difficult to get the majority of men who control the university system, the majority of men that control the military system, the majority of men that control the governments of the world, and the majority of men that control the great religions\\n\", 'So what is the basic thing that we need to do today? I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one, and where you come from, Europe and so forth, who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act, need to take the responsibility on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and women all over the world\\n', \" The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth\\n\", \" I didn't even go down to detail about that\\n\", ' But I hope that out of this conference, that every woman here will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market, need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters\\n', 'I have 12 grandchildren, four children, and 10 great-grandchildren, and I think often about them and about the plight that they will face in America, not only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country, in having equal rights, and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women and girls around the world and protect their human rights\\n', ' Thank you very much\\n', ' \\n', ' The challenge, so often, is hanging on to that as we grow up\\n', 'I will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast\\n', ' I will never forget the feeling of adventure as I climbed on board the boat and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time\\n', ' But the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom, the feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails\\n', ' As a four-year-old child, it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine\\n', 'So I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream\\n', ' Age 10, it was saving my school dinner money change\\n', \" Every day I would pile up the change on the top of my money box, and when that pile reached a pound, I would drop it in and cross off one of the 100 squares I'd drawn on a piece of paper\\n\", \" I read every book I could on sailing, and then eventually, having been told by my school I wasn't clever enough to be a vet, left school age 17 to begin my apprenticeship in sailing\\n\", 'So imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true\\n', ' I felt like my life depended on that moment, and incredibly, he said yes\\n', ' And I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting designing a boat on which I was going to sail solo nonstop around the world\\n', \" From that first meeting to the finish line of the race, it was everything I'd ever imagined\\n\", ' We missed an iceberg by 20 feet\\n', ' Nine times, I climbed to the top of her 90-foot mast\\n', ' We were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean\\n', ' But the sunsets, the wildlife, and the remoteness were absolutely breathtaking\\n', ' After three months at sea, age just 24, I finished in second position\\n', \" I'd loved it, so much so that within six months I decided to go around the world again, but this time not in a race: to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world\\n\", ' Now for this, I needed a different craft: bigger, wider, faster, more powerful\\n', ' Just to give that boat some scale, I could climb inside her mast all the way to the top\\n', ' Seventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide\\n', ' I affectionately called her Moby\\n', ' She was a multihull\\n', ' When we built her, no one had ever made it solo nonstop around the world in one, though many had tried, but whilst we built her, a Frenchman took a boat 25 percent bigger than her and not only did he make it, but he took the record from 93 days right down to 72\\n', 'And these boats were exciting to sail\\n', ' This was a training sail off the French coast\\n', ' Five seconds is all it took from everything being fine to our world going black as the

waves were already 40 to 50 feet high, and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard\\n', \" If we didn't sail fast enough, we'd be engulfed by that storm, and

Unbelievable\\n', \" So we thought about this and we said, it's kind of obvious, right? The better the technology gets, the less reliable the driver is going to get\\n\", \" So by just making the cars incrementally smarter, we're probably not going to see the wins we really need\\n\", 'Let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here\\n', \" So we're looking at this graph, and along the bottom is how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn't\\n\", \" You can ignore most of that axis, because if you're driving around town, and the car starts stopping randomly, you're never going to buy that car\\n\", \" And the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes when it's supposed to to help you avoid an accident\\n\", ' Now, if we look at the bottom left corner here, this is your classic car\\n', \" It doesn't apply the brakes for you, it doesn't do anything goofy, but it also doesn't get you out of an accident\\n\", \" But we'll pick some place along the curve here, and maybe it avoids half of accidents that the human driver misses, and that's amazing, right? We just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two\\n\", ' There are now 17,000 less people dying every year in America\\n', 'But if we want a self-driving car, we need a technology curve that looks like this\\n', \" We're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle, and we'll pick some operating point up here where it basically never gets into a crash\\n\", \" They'll happen, but very low frequency\\n\", ' Now you and I could look at this and we could argue about whether it\\'s incremental, and I could say something like \"80-20 rule,\" and it\\'s really hard to move up to that new curve\\n', ' And so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system\\n', ' It turns out that human drivers make mistakes that lead to traffic accidents about once every 100,000 miles in America\\n', \" In contrast, a self-driving system is probably making decisions about 10 times per second, so order of magnitude, that's about 1,000 times per mile\\n\", \" So if you compare the distance between these two, it's about 10 to the eighth, right? Eight orders of magnitude\\n\", \" It doesn't matter how hard I train, I'm never actually going to get there\\n\", \" So there's a pretty big gap there\\n\", ' So this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road, might not be\\n', \" I can't tell, nor can any of our algorithms, but in the case of a driver assistance system, that means it can't take action, because again, if it presses the brakes unexpectedly, that's completely unacceptable\\n\", \" Whereas a self-driving system can look at that pedestrian and say, I don't know what they're about to do, slow down, take a better look, and then react appropriately after that\\n\", 'So it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be\\n', \" So that's enough about the differences between the two\\n\", ' So here, all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road, and the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist, and up in the distance, if you look really closely, you can see some cones\\n', \" Then we know where the car is in the moment, but we have to do better than that: we have to predict what's going to happen\\n\", ' So here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed, so it needs to get out of the way\\n', \" Knowing that one pickup truck is great, but we really need to know what everybody's thinking, so it becomes quite a complicated problem\\n\", ' And then given that, we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment, so what trajectory it should follow, how quickly it should slow down or speed up\\n', ' And then that all turns into just following a path: turning the steering wheel left or right, pressing the brake or gas\\n', \" It's really just two numbers at the end of the day\\n\", ' So how hard can it really be?\\n', 'Back when we started in 2009, this is what our system looked like\\n', ' So you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road, driving down the highway\\n', ' The car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are\\n', \" It's really a geometric understanding of the world\\n\", ' Once we started driving on neighborhood and city streets, the problem becomes a whole new level of difficulty\\n', ' You see pedestrians crossing in front of us, cars crossing in front of us, going every which way, the traffic lights, crosswalks\\n', ' And then once you have that problem solved, the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction\\n', ' It has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well\\n', \" Similarly, the orange box on the side here, it's a school bus, and we have to treat that differently as well\\n\", ' And when a police officer stood in the road, our vehicle should understand that this means stop, and when they signal to go, we should continue\\n', 'Now, the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles\\n', ' The first, most crude model of this is when one vehicle sees a construction zone, having another know about it so it can be in the correct lane to avoid some of the difficulty\\n', ' But we actually have a much deeper understanding of this\\n', ' We could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time, the hundreds of thousands of pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles that have been out there and understand what they look like and use that to infer what other vehicles should look like and other pedestrians should look like\\n', ' And then, even more importantly, we could take from that a model of how we expect them to move through the world\\n', ' So here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us\\n', \" Here the blue box is a cyclist and we anticipate that they're going to nudge out and around the car to the right\\n\", \" Here there's a cyclist coming down the road and we know they're going to continue to drive down the shape of the road\\n\", \" Here somebody makes a right turn, and in a moment here, somebody's going to make a U-turn in front of us, and we can anticipate that behavior and respond safely\\n\", \"Now, that's all well and good for things that we've seen, but of course, you encounter lots of things that you haven't seen in the world before\\n\", ' And so just a couple of months ago, our vehicles were driving through Mountain View, and this is what we encountered\\n', ' This is a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck in circles on the road\\n', '  Now it turns out, there is nowhere in the DMV handbook that tells you how to deal with that, but our vehicles were able to encounter that, slow down, and drive safely\\n', \" Here we're dealing with a cyclist that you would never expect to see anywhere other than Mountain View\\n\", ' And of course, we have to deal with drivers, even the very small ones\\n', ' Watch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us\\n', ' And now, watch the left as the car with the green box decides he needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment\\n', ' Here, as we make a lane change, the car to our left decides it wants to as well\\n', ' And here, we watch a car blow through a red light and yield to it\\n', ' And similarly, here, a cyclist blowing through that light as well\\n', ' And of course, the vehicle responds safely\\n', \" And of course, we have people who do I don't know what sometimes on the road, like this guy pulling out between two self-driving cars\\n\", ' You have to ask, \"What are you thinking?\" \\n', \"Now, I just fire-hosed you with a lot of stuff there, so I'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly\\n\", \" So what we're looking at is the scene with the cyclist again, and you might notice in the bottom, we can't actually see the cyclist yet, but the car can: it's that little blue box up there, and that comes from the laser data\\n\", \" And that's not actually really easy to understand, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn that laser data and look at it, and if you're really good at looking at laser data, you can see a few dots on the curve there, right there, and that blue box is that cyclist\\n\", \" Now as our light is red, the cyclist's light has turned yellow already, and if you squint, you can see that in the imagery\\n\", ' But the cyclist, we see, is going to proceed through the intersection\\n', ' Our light has now turned green, his is solidly red, and we now anticipate that this bike is going to come all the way across\\n', \"Now, as you can see, we've made some pretty exciting progress, and at this point we're pretty convinced this technology is going to come to market\\n\", ' We do three million miles of testing in our simulators every single day, so you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have\\n', ' We are looking forward to having this technology on the road, and we think the right path is to go through the self-driving rather than driver assistance approach because the urgency is so large\\n', \" In the time I have given this talk today, 34 people have died on America's roads\\n\", \"How soon can we bring it out?
